Late propagation in software clones,L. Barbour; F. Khomh; Y. Zou,"Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Queen's University, Kingston, ON, Canada",2011 27th IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance (ICSM),20111117,2011,,,273,282,"Two similar code segments, or clones, form a clone pair within a software system. The changes to the clones over time create a clone evolution history. In this work we study late propagation, a specific pattern of clone evolution. In late propagation, one clone in the clone pair is modified, causing the clone pair to become inconsistent. The code segments are then re-synchronized in a later revision. Existing work has established late propagation as a clone evolution pattern, and suggested that the pattern is related to a high number of faults. In this study we examine the characteristics of late propagation in two long-lived software systems using the Simian and CCFinder clone detection tools. We define 8 types of late propagation and compare them to other forms of clone evolution. Our results not only verify that late propagation is more harmful to software systems, but also establish that some specific cases of late propagations are more harmful than others. Specifically, two cases are most risky: (1) when a clone experiences inconsistent changes and then a re-synchronizing change without any modification to the other clone in a clone pair; and (2) when two clones undergo an inconsistent modification followed by a re-synchronizing change that modifies both the clones in a clone pair.",1063-6773;10636773,Electronic:978-1-4577-0664-6; POD:978-1-4577-0663-9,10.1109/ICSM.2011.6080794,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6080794,clone genealogies;fault-proneness;late propagation,Cloning,software engineering,CCFinder clone detection tools;Simian clone detection tools;clone evolution history;code segments;late propagation;software clones;software system,,21,,17,,,,25-30 Sept. 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,9
SCOTCH: Test-to-code traceability using slicing and conceptual coupling,A. Qusef; G. Bavota; R. Oliveto; A. De Lucia; D. Binkley,"University of Salerno, Fisciano, Italy",2011 27th IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance (ICSM),20111117,2011,,,63,72,"Maintaining traceability links between unit tests and tested classes is an important factor for effectively managing the development and evolution of software systems. Exploiting traceability links helps in program comprehension and maintenance by ensuring consistency between unit tests and tested classes during maintenance activities. Unfortunately, it is often the case that such links are not explicitly maintained and thus they have to be recovered manually during software evolution. A novel automated solution to this problem, based on dynamic slicing and conceptual coupling, is presented. The resulting tool, SCOTCH (Slicing and Coupling based Test to Code trace Hunter), is empirically evaluated on three systems: an open source system and two industrial systems. The results indicate that SCOTCH identifies traceability links between unit test classes and tested classes with a high accuracy and greater stability than existing techniques, highlighting its potential usefulness as a feature within a software development environment.",1063-6773;10636773,Electronic:978-1-4577-0664-6; POD:978-1-4577-0663-9,10.1109/ICSM.2011.6080773,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6080773,Conceptual Coupling;Empirical Studies;Slicing;Traceability,Accuracy;Couplings;Java;Maintenance engineering;Measurement;Software;Testing,program slicing;program testing;public domain software;reverse engineering;software development management;software maintenance,SCOTCH;automated solution;conceptual coupling;dynamic slicing;industrial system;open source system;program comprehension;software system development management;software system evolution;test to code trace hunter;test-to-code traceability;traceability link maintenance,,16,,27,,,,25-30 Sept. 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,9

Automated change impact analysis for agent systems,H. K. Dam; A. Ghose,"School of Computer Science and Software Engineering, University of Wollongong, New South Wales 2522, Australia",2011 27th IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance (ICSM),20111117,2011,,,33,42,"Intelligent agent technology has evolved rapidly over the past few years along with the growing number of agent systems in various domains. Although a substantial amount of work in agent-oriented software engineering has provided methodologies for analysing, designing and implementing agent-based systems, recent studies have highlighted that there has been very little work on maintenance and evolution of agent-based systems. A critical issue in software maintenance and evolution is change impact analysis: determining the potential consequences of a proposed change. There has been a proliferation of techniques proposed to support change impact analysis of procedural or object-oriented systems, but to the best of our knowledge, no such an effort has been made for agent-based software. In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing a framework to support change impact analysis for agent systems. At the core of our framework is the taxonomy of atomic changes which can precisely capture semantic differences between versions of an agent system. We also present a change impact model in the form of an intra-agent dependency graph that represents various dependencies within an agent system. An algorithm to compute the set of entities impacted by a change is also presented. The proposed techniques have been implemented in AgentCIA, a change impact analysis plugin for Jason, one of the most well-known agent programming platforms.",1063-6773;10636773,Electronic:978-1-4577-0664-6; POD:978-1-4577-0663-9,10.1109/ICSM.2011.6080770,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6080770,,Computer architecture;Context;Libraries;Robots;Software maintenance;Taxonomy,graph theory;object-oriented programming;software agents;software maintenance,AgentCIA;Jason;agent programming platforms;agent systems;agent-oriented software engineering;atomic change taxonomy;automated change impact analysis;autonomous computational entity;intelligent agent technology;intra-agent dependency graph;object-oriented systems;procedural systems;semantic differences;software agent;software evolution;software maintenance,,6,,20,,,,25-30 Sept. 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,9
The evolution of Information Systems a case study on document management,P. Salvaneschi,"University of Bergamo, Faculty of Engineering, Dalmine, Italy",2011 27th IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance (ICSM),20111117,2011,,,428,437,The paper describes a case study whose aim is to verify a set of hypotheses related to the management of documents during the evolution of Information Systems. The idea is to distinguish the evolution documents (documents that support the evolution of long living applications) from the development documents (related to a single development step of the application life). The evolution documents are derived from the development documents using a minimalist approach and a cost-benefit analysis. The study involved ninety applications of a large information system of a retail company. We describe the context and the method of the study. We present the results and discuss both validity and scope. The evolution documents are a collection of selected parts of the development documents with a size reduction (in pages) of an order of magnitude. The study identifies minimal sets of document types for classes of software applications. These sets are organized into patterns of evolution documents. All the evolution documents are stored into a common knowledge base managed through a wiki-based tool.,1063-6773;10636773,Electronic:978-1-4577-0664-6; POD:978-1-4577-0663-9,10.1109/ICSM.2011.6080810,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6080810,document management;minimalism;software evolution,Databases;Information systems;Maintenance engineering;Software;Software architecture;Supply chains,Web sites;document handling;information systems;knowledge management;retail data processing;software maintenance,cost-benefit analysis;development documents;document management;evolution documents;information system evolution;minimalist approach;retail company;software evolution;wiki-based tool,,0,,28,,,,25-30 Sept. 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,9

To address these limitations, we present a framework for automatically extracting both exact and near-miss clone genealogies across multiple versions of a program and for identifying their change patterns using a few key similarity factors. We have developed a prototype clone genealogy extractor, applied it to three open source projects including the Linux Kernel, and evaluated its accuracy in terms of precision and recall.

While results showed strong correlations and good predictive power of these metrics, they do not distinguish between interface, abstract or concrete classes. In particular, interfaces declare contracts that are meant to remain stable during the evolution of a software system while the implementation in concrete classes is more likely to change. This paper aims at investigating to which extent the existing source code metrics can be used for predicting change-prone Java interfaces. We empirically investigate the correlation between metrics and the number of fine-grained source code changes in interfaces of ten Java open-source systems. Then, we evaluate the metrics to calculate models for predicting change-prone Java interfaces. Our results show that the external interface cohesion metric exhibits the strongest correlation with the number of source code changes.

However, metrics are usually defined on a micro-level (method, class, package), and should therefore be aggregated in order to provide insights in the evolution at the macro-level (system).

In this paper we present the results of an extensive correlation study of the most widely-used traditional and econometric aggregation techniques, applied to lifting SLOC values from class to package level in the 106 systems comprising the Qualitas Corpus. Moreover, we investigate the nature of this relation, and study its evolution on a subset of 12 systems from the Qualitas Corpus.

We conducted an empirical study with software development practitioners using source code from a small paint application written in Java, along with four semantics-preserving modification tasks (refactoring, defect correction) and four semantics-modifying modification tasks (enhancive and modification). Each task has a change specification and corresponding source code patch. The subjects were asked to comprehend the original source code and then judge whether each patch meets the corresponding change specification in the modification task. The subjects recorded the time to comprehend and described the comprehension strategies used and their reason for the patch judgments. The 24 subjects used similar comprehension strategies. The results show that the comprehension strategies and effort estimation metrics are not consistent across different types of modification tasks. The recorded descriptions indicate the subjects scanned through the original source code and the patches when trying to comprehend patches in the semantics-modifying tasks while the subjects only read the source code of the patches in semantics-preserving tasks.

This may occur because the rules are too generic and do not focus on domain specific problems of the software under analysis. We underwent an investigation of rules created for a specific domain based on expert opinion to understand if such rules are worthwhile enforcing in the context of defect prevention.

A solution is defined as a combination of refactorings that should maximize as much as possible the similarity between the expected revised model and the generated model after applying the refactoring sequence on the initial model.

Large-scale product families face rapidly increasing maintenance challenges as their evolution can happen both as a result of collective domain engineering activities, and as a result of product-specific developments. To make informed decisions about prospective modifications, developers need to estimate what other sections of the system will be affected and need attention, which is known as change impact analysis. This paper contributes a method to carry out change impact analysis in a component-based product family, based on system-wide information flow analysis. We use static program slicing as the underlying analysis technique, and use model-driven engineering (MDE) techniques to propagate the ripple effects from a source code modification into all members of the product family.

An empirical investigation into the impact of refactoring on regression testing,N. Rachatasumrit; M.

On the other hand, some believe that refactoring has the risk of functionality regression and increased testing cost. This paper investigates the impact of refactoring edits on regression tests using the version history of Java open source projects: (1) Are there adequate regression tests for refactoring in practice? (2) How many of existing regression tests are relevant to refactoring edits and thus need to be re-run for the new version? (3) What proportion of failure-inducing changes are relevant to refactorings? By using a refactoring reconstruction analysis and a change impact analysis in tandem, we investigate the relationship between the types and locations of refactoring edits identified by RefFinder and the affecting changes and affected tests identified by the FaultTracer change impact analysis. The results on three open source projects, JMeter, XMLSecurity, and ANT, show that only 22% of refactored methods and fields are tested by existing regression tests. While refactorings only constitutes 8% of atomic changes, 38% of affected tests are relevant to refactorings. Furthermore, refactorings are involved in almost half of the failed test cases.

When one project undergoes changes, other projects may decide to upgrade the dependency. For example, a project could use a new version of another project because the latter has been enhanced or subject to some bug-fixing activities. This paper reports an exploratory study aimed at observing the evolution of the Java subset of the Apache ecosystem, consisting of 147 projects, for a period of 14 years, and resulting in 1,964 releases. Specifically, we analyze (i) how dependencies change over time, (ii) whether a dependency upgrade is due to different kinds of factors, such as different kinds of API changes or licensing issues, and (iii) how an upgrade impacts on a related project.

LHDiff: A Language-Independent Hybrid Approach for Tracking Source Code Lines,M. Asaduzzaman; C. K. Roy; K. A. Schneider; M. D. Penta,"Dept. of Comput. Sci., Univ. of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada",2013 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance,20131202,2013,,,230,239,"Tracking source code lines between two different versions of a file is a fundamental step for solving a number of important problems in software maintenance such as locating bug introducing changes, tracking code fragments or defects across versions, merging file versions, and software evolution analysis. Although a number of such approaches are available in the literature, their performance is sensitive to the kind and degree of source code changes. There is also a marked lack of study on the effect of change types on source location tracking techniques. In this paper, we propose a language-independent technique, LHDiff, for tracking source code lines across versions that leverages simhash technique together with heuristics to improve accuracy. We evaluate our approach against state-of-the- art techniques using benchmarks containing different degrees of changes where files are selected from real world applications. We further evaluate LHDiff with other techniques using a mutation based analysis to understand how different types of changes affect their performance. The results reveal that our technique is more effective than language-independent approaches and no worse than some language-dependent techniques. In our study LHDiff even shows better performance than a state-of-the-art language- dependent approach.

While a lot of research has focused on supporting stakeholders in satisfying various information needs, there is little empirical evidence on how these information needs manifest themselves in the context of professional software development teams of real world companies. To investigate the information needs of the different stakeholder roles involved in software evolution activities, we conducted an empirical study with 23 participants from two professional development teams of one company. The analysis of the gathered data shows that information needs exhibit a crosscutting nature with respect to stakeholder role, activity, artifacts and even fragments of artifacts. We also found that the dependencies between information artifacts are important for the successful performance of software evolution activities, but often not captured explicitly. The lack of an explicit representation of these interdependencies often result in difficulties identifying dependent artifacts and additional communication effort.

Despite the benefits of new or updated APIs, developers are often slow to adopt the new APIs. As a first step toward understanding the impact of API evolution on software ecosystems, we conduct an in-depth case study of the co-evolution behavior of Android API and dependent applications using the version history data found in github. Our study confirms that Android is evolving fast at a rate of 115 API updates per month on average. Client adoption, however, is not catching up with the pace of API evolution. About 28% of API references in client applications are outdated with a median lagging time of 16 months. 22% of outdated API usages eventually upgrade to use newer API versions, but the propagation time is about 14 months, much slower than the average API release interval (3 months). Fast evolving APIs are used more by clients than slow evolving APIs but the average time taken to adopt new versions is longer for fast evolving APIs. Further, API usage adaptation code is more defect prone than the one without API usage adaptation.

The effect such clones have on software quality and maintainability in particular has been subject to various studies in the recent past. Although negative effects could not be confirmed in general, a non-negligible number of situations where clones did cause problems has been found. Hence, there may be yet unknown influencing factors that cause these problems. One such factor may be the number of developers involved in the creation and maintenance of a clone. The interaction of multiple developers, unevenly distributed knowledge and communication deficiencies may lead to unwanted inconsistencies and bugs, when the clones are changed. This paper presents an empirical study on long-lived software systems, in which we analyze how many developers are involved in the maintenance exact clones and whether the number of developers affects the likelihood of inconsistent changes.

In this paper, we present an approach for mining logical clones in software that reveal high-level business and programming rules. Our approach extracts a program model from source code, and enriches the program model with code clone information, functional clusters (i.e., a set of methods dealing with similar topics or concerns), and abstract entity classes (representing sibling entity classes). It then analyzes the enriched program model for mining recurring logical structures as logical clones.

Second, we introduce clearly-defined contributor roles, which capture multiple project facets. Third, we propose a graph model, based on contributor collaborations, that captures the hierarchical structure of the contributor community in a concise yet informative way. We demonstrate the model's usefulness in two ways: (a) for identifying the structure and evolution of contributor interactions, (b) for predicting contributor roles.

Practitioners recognize that the content of a bug report depends on its author's expert knowledge. In this paper, we present an empirical study of the textual difference between bug reports written by experts and non-experts.

Writing Acceptable Patches: An Empirical Study of Open Source Project Patches,Y. Tao; D. Han; S. Kim,,2014 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution,20141206,2014,,,271,280,"Software developers submit patches to handle tens or even hundreds of bugs reported daily. However, not all submitted patches can be directly integrated into the code base, since they might not pass patch review that is adopted in most software projects. As the result of patch review, incoming patches can be rejected or asked for resubmission after improvement. Both scenarios interrupt the workflow of patch writers and reviewers, increase their workload, and potentially delay the general development process. In this paper, we aim to help developers write acceptable patches to avoid patch rejection and resubmission. To this end, we derive a comprehensive list of patch rejection reasons from a manual inspection of 300 rejected Eclipse and Mozilla patches, a large-scale online survey of Eclipse and Mozilla developers, and the literature. We also investigate which patch-rejection reasons are more decisive and which are difficult to judge from the perspective of patch reviewers. Our findings include 1) suboptimal solution and incomplete fix are the most frequent patch-rejection reasons 2) whether a patch introduces new bugs is very important yet very difficult to judge 3) reviewers reject a large patch not solely because of its size, but mainly because of the underlying reasons that induce its large size, such as the involvement of unnecessary changes 4) reviewers consider certain problems to be much more destructive than patch writers expect, such as the inconsistency of documentation in a patch and 5) bad timing of patch submission and a lack of communication with team members can also result in a negative patch review.",1063-6773;10636773,Electronic:978-1-4799-6146-7; POD:978-1-4799-6147-4,10.1109/ICSME.2014.49,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6976093,empirical study;patch,Computer bugs;Documentation;Encoding;Guidelines;Inspection;Manuals,program debugging;program diagnostics;software development management,Eclipse developers;Eclipse patches;Mozilla developers;Mozilla patches;acceptable patch writing;codebase;open source project patches;patch rejection;patch resubmission;patch reviewers;software bugs;software developers;software development process;software projects,,6,,38,,,,Sept. 29 2014-Oct. 3 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,9

Changes to the system are then modeled at the behavioral level using the difference between the system dictionaries of two versions. The three different granularities of slice (i.e., line, function, and file) are analyzed. We use a direct extension of srcML to represent computed change information. The retrieved information reflects the fact that additional knowledge of the differences can be automatically derived to help maintainers understand code changes.

Amongst the different implementations of built-in EHM, we classify them in two main categories: reliability-driven and maintenance-driven. Some programming languages, such as Java, provide built-in exception handling mechanisms that promote reliability-driven EHMs. Maintenance-driven EHMs, on the other hand, promote software maintainability by not forcing developers to specify exception handling constraints. Most of modern languages, such as C#, Ruby, Python and many others support this approach. Developers usually have to choose between maintainability-driven and reliability-driven approaches to structure exception handling in their applications. However, there is still little empirical knowledge about the impact that adopting these mechanisms have on software robustness and maintenance. This paper addressed this gap by conducting an empirical study aimed at understanding the relationship between changes in Java and C# programs and their robustness. In particular, we evaluated how changes in the normal and exceptional code were related to exception handling faults.

Prevalence and Maintenance of Automated Functional Tests for Web Applications,L. Christophe; R. Stevens; C. D. Roover; W. D. Meuter,"Software Languages Lab., Vrije Univ. Brussel, Brussels, Belgium",2014 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution,20141206,2014,,,141,150,"Functional testing requires executing particular sequences of user actions. Test automation tools enable scripting user actions such that they can be repeated more easily. SELENIUM, for instance, enables testing Web applications through scripts that interact with a Web browser and assert properties about its observable state. However, little is known about how common such tests are in practice. We therefore present a cross-sectional quantitative study of the prevalence of SELENIUM-based tests among open-source Web applications, and of the extent to which such tests are used within individual applications. Automating functional tests also brings about the problem of maintaining test scripts. As the system under test evolves, its test scripts are bound to break. Even less is known about the way test scripts change over time. We therefore also present a longitudinal quantitative study of whether and for how long test scripts are maintained, as well as a longitudinal qualitative study of the kind of changes they undergo.

Enhancing Clone-and-Own with Systematic Reuse for Developing Software Variants,S. Fischer; L. Linsbauer; R. E. Lopez-Herrejon; A. Egyed,"Johannes Kepler Univ., Linz, Austria",2014 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution,20141206,2014,,,391,400,"To keep pace with the increasing demand for custom-tailored software systems, companies often apply a practice called clone-and-own, whereby a new variant of a software system is built by coping and adapting existing variants. Instead of a single and configurable system, clone-and-own leads to ad hoc product portfolios of multiple yet similar variants that soon become impossible to maintain effectively. Clone-and-own has widespread industrial use because it requires no major upfront investments and is intuitive, but it lacks a methodology for systematic reuse. In this work we propose ECCO (Extraction and Composition for Clone-and-Own), a novel approach to enhance clone and-own that actively supports the development and maintenance of software product variants. A software engineer selects the desired features and ECCO finds the proper software artifacts to reuse and then provides guidance during the manual completion by hinting which software artifacts may need adaptation. We evaluated our approach on 6 case studies, covering 402 variants having up to 344KLOC, and found that precision and recall of composed products quickly reach a near optimum (>95% reuse).",1063-6773;10636773,Electronic:978-1-4799-6146-7; POD:978-1-4799-6147-4,10.1109/ICSME.2014.61,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6976105,clone-and-own;feature interactions;features;product variants;reuse,Color;Feature extraction;Java;Manuals;Portfolios;Software;Solids,investment;software maintenance;software reusability,ECCO approach;ad hoc product portfolios;clone-and-own enhancement;custom-tailored software systems;extraction and composition for clone-and-own approach;software artifacts;software product variant maintenance;software variant development;systematic reuse,,13,,16,,,,Sept. 29 2014-Oct. 3 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,9
Scaling Testing of Refactoring Engines,M. Mongiovi; G. Mendes; R. Gheyi; G. Soares; M. Ribeiro,"Fed. Univ. of Campina Grande, Campina Grande, Brazil",2014 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution,20141206,2014,,,371,380,"Proving refactoring sound with respect to a formal semantics is considered a challenge. In practice, developers write test cases to check their refactoring implementations. However, it is difficult and time consuming to have a good test suite since it requires complex inputs (programs) and an oracle to check whether it is possible to apply the transformation. If it is possible, the resulting program must preserve the observable behavior. There are some automated techniques for testing refactoring engines. Nevertheless, they may have limitations related to the program generator (exhaustiveness, setup, expressiveness), automation (types of oracles, bug categorization), time consumption or kinds of refactorings that can be tested. In this paper, we extend our previous technique to test refactoring engines. We improve expressiveness of the program generator for testing more kinds of refactorings, such as Extract Function. Moreover, developers just need to specify the input's structure in a declarative language. They may also set the technique to skip some consecutive test inputs to improve performance. We evaluate our technique in 18 refactoring implementations of Java (Eclipse and JRRT) and C (Eclipse). We identify 76 bugs (53 new bugs) related to compilation errors, behavioral changes, and overly strong conditions. We also compare the impact of the skip on the time consumption and bug detection in our technique. By using a skip of 25 in the program generator, it reduces in 96% the time to test the refactoring implementations while missing only 3.9% of the bugs. In a few seconds, it finds the first failure related to compilation error or behavioral change.",1063-6773;10636773,Electronic:978-1-4799-6146-7; POD:978-1-4799-6147-4,10.1109/ICSME.2014.59,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6976103,Refactoring;automated testing;program generation,Automatic programming;Automation;Computer bugs;Engines;Java;Metals;Testing,C language;Java;automatic programming;program compilers;program debugging;program testing;software maintenance,C language;Eclipse;JRRT;Java language;automated techniques;behavioral changes;bug categorization;compilation errors;complex inputs;consecutive test inputs;declarative language;extract function;formal semantics;input structure;oracle types;performance improvement;program automation;program exhaustiveness;program generator expressiveness improvement;program setup;refactoring engine testing;refactoring implementations;refactoring types;scaling testing;test suite;test time reduction;time consumption,,0,,25,,,,Sept. 29 2014-Oct. 3 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,9

Refactoring Fat Interfaces Using a Genetic Algorithm,D. Romano; S. Raemaekers; M. Pinzger,"Software Eng. Res.

Fat interfaces (i.e., interfaces violating the ISP) change more frequently and degrade the quality of the components coupled to them. According to the ISP the interfaces' design should force no client to depend on methods it does not invoke. Fat interfaces should be split into smaller interfaces exposing only the methods invoked by groups of clients. However, applying the ISP is a challenging task when fat interfaces are invoked differently by many clients. In this paper, we formulate the problem of applying the ISP as a multi-objective clustering problem and we propose a genetic algorithm to solve it. We evaluate the capability of the proposed genetic algorithm with 42,318 public Java APIs whose clients' usage has been mined from the Maven repository.

Mining Co-change Information to Understand When Build Changes Are Necessary,S. Mcintosh; B. Adams; M. Nagappan; A. E. Hassan,"Sch. of Comput., Queen's Univ., Kingston, ON, Canada",2014 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution,20141206,2014,,,241,250,"As a software project ages, its source code is modified to add new features, restructure existing ones, and fix defects. These source code changes often induce changes in the build system, i.e., the system that specifies how source code is translated into deliverables. However, since developers are often not familiar with the complex and occasionally archaic technologies used to specify build systems, they may not be able to identify when their source code changes require accompanying build system changes. This can cause build breakages that slow development progress and impact other developers, testers, or even users. In this paper, we mine the source and test code changes that required accompanying build changes in order to better understand this co-change relationship. We build random forest classifiers using language-agnostic and language-specific code change characteristics to explain when code-accompanying build changes are necessary based on historical trends. Case studies of the Mozilla C++ system, the Lucene and Eclipse open source Java systems, and the IBM Jazz proprietary Java system indicate that our classifiers can accurately explain when build co-changes are necessary with an AUC of 0.60-0.88. Unsurprisingly, our highly accurate C++ classifiers (AUC of 0.88) derive much of their explanatory power from indicators of structural change (e.g., was a new source file added?). On the other hand, our Java classifiers are less accurate (AUC of 0.60-0.78) because roughly 75% of Java build co-changes do not coincide with changes to the structure of a system, but rather are instigated by concerns related to release engineering, quality assurance, and general build maintenance.",1063-6773;10636773,Electronic:978-1-4799-6146-7; POD:978-1-4799-6147-4,10.1109/ICSME.2014.46,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6976090,Build systems;mining software repositories;software evolution,Data mining;Java;Libraries;Maintenance engineering;Software;Testing;Training,C++ language;Java;data mining;program compilers;source code (software),C++ classifiers;Eclipse open source Java systems;IBM Jazz proprietary;Java classifiers;Lucene open source Java systems;Mozilla C++ system;archaic technologies;language agnostic code;language specific code;mining cochange information;random forest classifiers;software project;source code,,9,,28,,,,Sept. 29 2014-Oct. 3 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,9

Our technique has been implemented in a tool which helps users detecting faults. To validate the proposed technique, we consider a well-known and well-documented catalog of faulty spreadsheets.

To recommend completion proposals, CSCC ranks candidate methods by the similarities between their contexts and the context of the target call.

"Recommending Clones for Refactoring Using Design, Context, and History",W. Wang; M. W. Godfrey,"Sch. of Comput. Sci., Univ. of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada",2014 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution,20141206,2014,,,331,340,"Developers know that copy-pasting code (aka code cloning) is often a convenient shortcut to achieving a design goal, albeit one that carries risks to the code quality over time. However, deciding which, if any, clones should be eliminated within an existing system is a daunting task. Fixing a clone usually means performing an invasive refactoring, and not all clones may be worth the effort, cost, and risk that such a change entails. Furthermore, sometimes cloning fulfils a useful design role, and should not be refactored at al. And clone detection tools often return very large result sets, making it hard to choose which clones should be investigated and possibly removed. In this paper, we propose an automated approach to recommend clones for refactoring by training a decision tree-based classifier. We analyze more than 600 clone instances in three medium-to large-sized open source projects, and we collect features that are associated with the source code, the context, and the history of clone instances. Our approach achieves a precision of around 80% in recommending clone refactoring instances for each target system, and similarly good precision is achieved in cross-project evaluation. By recommending which clones are appropriate for refactoring, our approach allows for better resource allocation for refactoring itself after obtaining clone detection results, and can thus lead to improved clone management in practice.",1063-6773;10636773,Electronic:978-1-4799-6146-7; POD:978-1-4799-6147-4,10.1109/ICSME.2014.55,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6976099,Clone Management;Code Refactoring;Software Clones;Software Recommendation System,Cloning;Context;Detectors;Feature extraction;History;Software systems,decision trees;pattern classification;software maintenance,clone detection;clone instance context;clone instance history;clone management;clone refactoring instances;code cloning;decision tree-based classifier;open source projects;resource allocation;source code,,5,,48,,,,Sept. 29 2014-Oct. 3 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,9
Empirical Analysis of the Relationship between CC and SLOC in a Large Corpus of Java Methods,D. Landman; A. Serebrenik; J.

Cyclomatic Complexity (CC) is an often used source code quality metric, next to Source Lines of Code (SLOC). However, the use of the CC metric is challenged by the repeated claim that CC is redundant with respect to SLOC due to strong linear correlation. We test this claim by studying a corpus of 17.8M methods in 13K open-source Java projects. Our results show that direct linear correlation between SLOC and CC is only moderate, as caused by high variance. We observe that aggregating CC and SLOC over larger units of code improves the correlation, which explains reported results of strong linear correlation in literature. We suggest that the primary cause of correlation is the aggregation. Our conclusion is that there is no strong linear correlation between CC and SLOC of Java methods, so we do not conclude that CC is redundant with SLOC. This conclusion contradicts earlier claims from literature, but concurs with the widely accepted practice of measuring of CC next to SLOC.",1063-6773;10636773,Electronic:978-1-4799-6146-7; POD:978-1-4799-6147-4,10.1109/ICSME.2014.44,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6976088,cylcomatic complexity;emperical research;software quality,Complexity theory;Correlation;Java;Measurement;Software;Transforms,Java;public domain software;software metrics;software quality;source code (software),CC;Java methods;SLOC;cyclomatic complexity;internal source code quality measurement;open-source Java projects;software development;source code quality metric;source lines-of-code;strong linear correlation,,5,,44,,,,Sept. 29 2014-Oct. 3 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,9
Understanding Log Lines Using Development Knowledge,W. Shang; M. Nagappan; A. E. Hassan; Z. M. Jiang,"Sch. of Comput., Queen's Univ., Kingston, ON, Canada",2014 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution,20141206,2014,,,21,30,"Logs are generated by output statements that developers insert into the code. By recording the system behaviour during runtime, logs play an important role in the maintenance of large software systems. The rich nature of logs has introduced a new market of log management applications (e.g., Splunk, XpoLog and log stash) that assist in storing, querying and analyzing logs. Moreover, recent research has demonstrated the importance of logs in operating, understanding and improving software systems. Thus log maintenance is an important task for the developers. However, all too often practitioners (i.e., operators and administrators) are left without any support to help them unravel the meaning and impact of specific log lines. By spending over 100 human hours and manually examining all the email threads in the mailing list for three open source systems (Hadoop, Cassandra and Zookeeper) and performing web search on sampled logging statements, we found 15 email inquiries and 73 inquiries from web search about different log lines. We identified that five types of development knowledge that are often sought from the logs by practitioners: meaning, cause, context, impact and solution. Due to the frequency and nature of log lines about which real customers inquire, documenting all the log lines or identifying which ones to document is not efficient. Hence in this paper we propose an on-demand approach, which associates the development knowledge present in various development repositories (e.g., code commits and issues reports) with the log lines.

However, after an issue has been addressed, it must be integrated into an official release to become visible to users. In theory, issues should be integrated into releases soon after they are addressed. Yet in practice, the integration of an addressed issue might be delayed. For instance, an addressed issue might be delayed in order to assess the impact that it may have on the system as a whole. While one can often speculate, it is not always clear why some addressed issues are integrated immediately, while others are delayed. In this paper, we empirically study the integration of 20,995 addressed issues from the Argo UML, Eclipse, and Fire fox projects. Our results indicate that: (i) despite being addressed well before the release date, the integration of 34% to 60% of addressed issues in systems with traditional release cycle, and 98% of addressed issues in systems with rapid release cycle were delayed by one or more releases, (ii) using information derived from the addressed issues, we are able to accurately predict the release in which an addressed issue will be integrated, achieving a Receiver Operator Curve (ROC) area of above 0.74, and (iii) the workload of integrators is the most influential factor in our integration delay models. Our results indicate that integration can introduce non-negligible delays that prevent addressed issues from being delivered to users.

The most commonly used approach by mobile developers for preventing piracy is code obfuscation. However, the decision to apply such transformations is currently made without regard to the impacts of obfuscations on another area of increasing concern for mobile application developers: energy consumption. Because both software piracy and battery life are important concerns, mobile application developers must strike a balance between protecting their applications and preserving the battery lives of their users' devices. To help them make such choices, we conducted an empirical study of the effects of 18 code obfuscations on the amount of energy consumed by executing a total of 15 usage scenarios spread across 11 Android applications.

Such incomplete or temporary workarounds are commonly referred to as 'technical debt'. Our experience indicates that self-admitted technical debt is common in software projects and may negatively impact software maintenance, however, to date very little is known about them. Therefore, in this paper, we use source-code comments in four large open source software projects-Eclipse, Chromium OS, Apache HTTP Server, and ArgoUML to identify self-admitted technical debt. Using the identified technical debt, we study 1) the amount of self-admitted technical debt found in these projects, 2) why this self-admitted technical debt was introduced into the software projects and 3) how likely is the self-admitted technical debt to be removed after their introduction. We find that the amount of self-admitted technical debt exists in 2.4%-31% of the files. Furthermore, we find that developers with higher experience tend to introduce most of the self-admitted technical debt and that time pressures and complexity of the code do not correlate with the amount of self-admitted technical debt. Lastly, although self-admitted technical debt is meant to be addressed or removed in the future, only between 26.3%-63.5% of self-admitted technical debt gets removed from projects after introduction.",1063-6773;10636773,Electronic:978-1-4799-6146-7; POD:978-1-4799-6147-4,10.1109/ICSME.2014.31,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6976075,Software comments;Technical debt,Chromium;Complexity theory;Computer hacking;Correlation;Java;Software maintenance,project management;public domain software;software maintenance;software management;software quality,Apache HTTP Server;ArgoUML;Chromium OS;Eclipse;open source software projects;self-admitted technical debt;software maintenance;software quality;source-code comments,,19,,22,,,,Sept. 29 2014-Oct. 3 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,9
Why Do Automated Builds Break? An Empirical Study,N. Kerzazi; F. Khomh; B. Adams,"R&D Dept., Payza.com, Montreal, QC, Canada",2014 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution,20141206,2014,,,41,50,"To detect integration errors as quickly as possible, organizations use automated build systems. Such systems ensure that (1) the developers are able to integrate their parts into an executable whole, (2) the testers are able to test the built system, (3) and the release engineers are able to leverage the generated build to produce the upcoming release. The flipside of automated builds is that any incorrect change can break the build, and hence testing and releasing, and (even worse) block other developers from continuing their work, delaying the project even further. To measure the impact of such build breakage, this empirical study analyzes 3,214 builds produced in a large software company over a period of 6 months. We found a high ratio of build breakage (17.9%), and also quantified the cost of such build breakage as more than 336.18 man-hours. Interviews with 28 software engineers from the company helped to understand the circumstances under which builds are broken and the effects of build breakages on the collaboration and coordination of teams. We quantitatively investigated the main factors impacting build breakage and found that build failures correlate with the number of simultaneous contributors on branches, the type of work items performed on a branch, and the roles played by the stakeholders of the builds (for example developers vs. Integrators).",1063-6773;10636773,Electronic:978-1-4799-6146-7; POD:978-1-4799-6147-4,10.1109/ICSME.2014.26,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6976070,Automated Builds;Data Mining;Empirical Software Engineering;Software Quality,Collaboration;Companies;Context;Interviews;Software;Statistical analysis,error detection;program testing;software quality,automated build systems;build breakage;build failures;integration error detection;software company;software quality,,11,,23,,,,Sept. 29 2014-Oct. 3 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,9
On the Use of Stack Traces to Improve Text Retrieval-Based Bug Localization,L. Moreno; J. J. Treadway; A. Marcus; W. Shen,"Dept. of Comput. Sci., Univ. of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA",2014 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution,20141206,2014,,,151,160,"Many bug localization techniques rely on Text Retrieval (TR) models. The most successful approaches have been proven to be the ones combining TR techniques with static analysis, dynamic analysis, and/or software repositories information. Dynamic software analysis and software repositories mining bring a significant overhead, as they require instrumenting and executing the software, and analyzing large amounts of data, respectively. We propose a new static technique, named Lobster (Locating Bugs using Stack Traces and text Retrieval), which is meant to improve TR-based bug localization without the overhead associated with dynamic analysis and repository mining. Specifically, we use the stack traces submitted in a bug report to compute the similarity between their code elements and the source code of a software system. We combine the stack trace based similarity and the textual similarity provided by TR techniques to retrieve code elements relevant to bug reports. We empirically evaluated Lobster using 155 bug reports containing stack traces from 14 open source software systems. We used Lucene, an optimized version of VSM, as baseline of comparison. The results show that, in average, Lobster improves or maintains the effectiveness of Lucene-based bug localization in 82% of the cases.",1063-6773;10636773,Electronic:978-1-4799-6146-7; POD:978-1-4799-6147-4,10.1109/ICSME.2014.37,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6976081,bug localization;stack traces;static analysis;text retrieval,Conferences;Software maintenance,information retrieval;program debugging;text analysis,TR models;TR techniques;bug localization techniques;dynamic analysis;improve text retrieval;software analysis;software repositories information;software repositories mining;software system;source code;stack traces;static analysis;textual similarity,,8,,29,,,,Sept. 29 2014-Oct. 3 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,9

Refactoring Java Concurrent Programs Based on Synchronization Requirement Analysis,B. Tao; J. Qian,"Coll. of Comput. Sci. & Technol., Nanjing Univ. of Aeronaut. & Astronaut., Nanjing, China",2014 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution,20141206,2014,,,361,370,"Writing high quality concurrent programs is challenging. A concurrent program that is not well-written may suffer from coarse synchronization problems, e.g., overly-large critical sections, overly-coarse locks, and etc. These coarse synchronizations may introduce unnecessary lock contention and thereby affect the parallel execution of running threads. To optimize them, people suggest use refactorings, e.g., Split Lock refactoring and Split Critical Section refactoring, to gradually evolve the synchronization code for better parallelism. However, manually identifying the refactoring opportunities is difficult and by-hand code transformations are error-prone. To reduce the manual efforts, this paper proposes an automated refactoring approach for Java concurrent programs based on synchronization requirement analysis. It can automatically analyze the existing synchronization code to identify synchronization requirements. Bases on these requirements, we can find Split Lock, Split Critical Section, and Convert to Atomic refactoring opportunities and then make proper code transformation for each of them. Our experiment shows that the approach does find effective refactoring opportunities in real projects and can transform the refactorable code correctly. This indicates the approach could be helpful for concurrent program evolution.",1063-6773;10636773,Electronic:978-1-4799-6146-7; POD:978-1-4799-6147-4,10.1109/ICSME.2014.58,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6976102,Java;concurrency;refactoring;synchronization,Algorithm design and analysis;Concurrent computing;Frequency synchronization;Java;Programming;Shape;Synchronization,Java;formal verification;software maintenance,coarse synchronization problems;hand code transformations;parallel execution;refactoring Java concurrent programs;split critical section refactoring;split lock refactoring;synchronization code;synchronization requirement analysis,,2,,23,,,,Sept. 29 2014-Oct. 3 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,9

Researchers have developed many clone detection tools to detect and analyze code clones in software systems. These tools report code clones as similar code fragments in source files. However, clone-related maintenance tasks (e.g., refactorings) often involve a group of code clones appearing in larger syntactic context (e.g., code clones in sibling classes or code clones calling similar methods). Given a list of low-level code-fragment clones, developers have to manually summarize from bottom up low-level code clones that are relevant to the syntactic context of a maintenance task. In this paper, we present a clone summarization technique to summarize code clones with respect to their common syntactic context. The clone summarization allows developers to locate and maintain code clones in a top-down manner by type hierarchy and usage dependencies.

This perception, however, has been questioned by some due the lack of supporting evidence. This paper presents an empirical analysis focusing on the relationship between the utilization of open source components and their engineering quality. In this study, we determine the popularity of 2,406 Maven components by calculating their usage across 55,191 open source Java projects. As a proxy of code quality for a component, we calculate (i) its defect density using the set of bug patterns reported by Find Bugs, and (ii) 9 popular software quality metrics from the SQO-OSS quality model. We then look for correlations between (i) popularity and defect density, and (ii) popularity and software quality metrics. In most of the cases, no correlations were found. In cases where minor correlations exist, they are driven by component size. Statistically speaking, and using the methods in this study, the Maven repository does not seem to support the ""many eyeballs"" effect.

On top of such catalogues, researchers have defined methods and tools to automatically detect and/or remove bad smells. Nevertheless, there is an ongoing debate regarding the extent to which developers perceive bad smells as serious design problems. Indeed, there seems to be a gap between theory and practice, i.e., what is believed to be a problem (theory) and what is actually a problem (practice). This paper presents a study aimed at providing empirical evidence on how developers perceive bad smells. In this study, we showed to developers code entities -- belonging to three systems -- affected and not by bad smells, and we asked them to indicate whether the code contains a potential design problem, and if any, the nature and severity of the problem.

A Fine-Grained Analysis on the Evolutionary Coupling of Cloned Code,M. Mondal; C. K. Roy; K. A. Schneider,"Dept. of Comput. Sci., Univ. of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada",2014 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution,20141206,2014,,,51,60,"Code clones are identical or similar code fragments in a code base. A group of code fragments that are similar to one another forms a clone class. Clone fragments from the same clone class often need to be changed together consistently and thus, they exhibit evolutionary coupling. Evolutionary coupling among clone fragments within a clone class has already been investigated and reported. However, a change to a clone fragment of a clone class may also trigger changes to non-cloned code as well as to clone fragments of other clone classes. Such coupling information is equally important for the proper management of clones during software maintenance. Unfortunately, there are no such studies reported in the literature. In this paper, we describe a large scale empirical study that we conduct to examine whether a clone fragment from a particular clone class exhibits evolutionary coupling with non-clone fragments and/or with clone fragments of other clone classes. Our experimental results on thousands of revisions of six diverse subject systems written in two programming languages indicate the presence of such couplings. We consider both exact and near-miss clones in our study. By analyzing the evolutionary couplings of a particular clone fragment from a particular clone class, we are able to predict its three types of co-change candidates with considerable accuracy in terms of precision and recall. These co-change candidates are: (1) non-clone fragments, (2) clone fragments from clone classes other than its own class, and (3) other clone fragments from its own clone class. Thus, we can improve existing clone tracking techniques so that they can also infer and suggest which non-clone fragments as well as which clone fragments from other clone classes might need to be co-changed correspondingly when modifying a clone fragment from a particular clone class.",1063-6773;10636773,Electronic:978-1-4799-6146-7; POD:978-1-4799-6147-4,10.1109/ICSME.2014.27,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6976071,Association Rule;Clone Tracking;Co-change Candidate;Code Clones;Evolutionary Coupling,Association rules;Cloning;Couplings;Java;Software maintenance;Software systems,software maintenance,clone fragment;clone tracking techniques;cloned code evolutionary coupling;co-change candidates;exact clones;fine-grained analysis;near-miss clones;programming languages;software maintenance,,2,,37,,,,Sept. 29 2014-Oct. 3 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,9

To address this problem, information retrieval (IR) based bug localization has increasingly been used to suggest potential buggy files given a bug report. To date, researchers have proposed a number of IR techniques for bug localization and empirically evaluated them to understand their effectiveness. However, virtually all of the evaluations have been limited to the projects written in object-oriented programming languages, particularly Java. Therefore, the effectiveness of these techniques for other widely used languages such as C is still unknown. In this paper, we create a benchmark dataset consisting of more than 7,500 bug reports from five popular C projects and rigorously evaluate our recently introduced IR-based bug localization tool using this dataset. Our results indicate that although the IR-relevant properties of C and Java programs are different, IR-based bug localization in C software at the file level is overall as effective as in Java software.

In this paper, we propose to use segmentation and stack-trace analysis to improve the performance of bug localization. Specifically, given a bug report, we divide each source code file into a series of segments and use the segment most similar to the bug report to represent the file. We also analyze the bug report to identify possible faulty files in a stack trace and favor these files in our retrieval. According to our empirical results, our approach is able to significantly improve Bug Locator, a representative fault localization approach, on all the three software projects (i.e., Eclipse, AspectJ, and SWT) used in our empirical evaluation. Furthermore, segmentation and stack-trace analysis are complementary to each other for boosting the performance of bug-report-oriented fault localization.",1063-6773;10636773,Electronic:978-1-4799-6146-7; POD:978-1-4799-6147-4,10.1109/ICSME.2014.40,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6976084,bug report;fault localization;feature location;information retrieval,Computer bugs;Information retrieval;Java;Logistics;Measurement;Noise;Software,fault diagnosis;information retrieval;program debugging;program diagnostics;source code (software),AspectJ;Eclipse;SWT;boosting bug-report-oriented fault localization;bug localization;bug locator;bug reportq;faulty files;information retrieval;post-release bugs;public bug repository;representative fault localization approach;software projects;source code file;source files;stack-trace analysis;stack-trace information,,10,,46,,,,Sept. 29 2014-Oct. 3 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,9
Evaluating Modern Clone Detection Tools,J. Svajlenko; C. K. Roy,"Dept. of Comput. Sci., Univ. of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada",2014 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution,20141206,2014,,,321,330,"Many clone detection tools and techniques have been introduced in the literature, and these tools have been used to manage clones and study their effects on software maintenance and evolution. However, the performance of these modern tools is not well known, especially recall. In this paper, we evaluate and compare the recall of eleven modern clone detection tools using four benchmark frameworks, including: (1) Bellon's Framework, (2) our modification to Bellon's Framework to improve the accuracy of its clone matching metrics, (3) Murakamki et al.'s extension of Bellon's Framework which adds type 3 gap awareness to the framework, and (4) our Mutation and Injection Framework. Bellon's Framework uses a curated corpus of manually validated clones detected by tools contemporary to 2002. In contrast, our Mutation and Injection Framework synthesizes a corpus of artificial clones using a cloning taxonomy produced in 2009. While still very popular in the clone community, there is some concern that Bellon's corpus may not be accurate for modern clone detection tools. We investigate the accuracy of the frameworks by (1) checking for anomalies in their results, (2) checking for agreement between the frameworks, and (3) checking for agreement with our expectations of these tools. Our expectations are researched and flexible. While expectations may contain inaccuracies, they are valuable for identifying possible inaccuracies in a benchmark. We find anomalies in the results of Bellon's Framework, and disagreement with both our expectations and the Mutation Framework. We conclude that Bellon's Framework may not be accurate for modern tools, and that an update of its corpus with clones detected by the modern tools is warranted. The results of the Mutation Framework agree with our expectations in most cases.

Learning to Combine Multiple Ranking Metrics for Fault Localization,J. Xuan; M. Monperrus,"INRIA Lille - Nord Eur., Lille, France",2014 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution,20141206,2014,,,191,200,"Fault localization is an inevitable step in software debugging. Spectrum-based fault localization consists in computing a ranking metric on execution traces to identify faulty source code. Existing empirical studies on fault localization show that there is no optimal ranking metric for all faults in practice. In this paper, we propose Multric, a learning-based approach to combining multiple ranking metrics for effective fault localization. In Multric, a suspiciousness score of a program entity is a combination of existing ranking metrics. Multric consists two major phases: learning and ranking. Based on training faults, Multric builds a ranking model by learning from pairs of faulty and non-faulty source code elements. When a new fault appears, Multric computes the final ranking with the learned model. Experiments are conducted on 5386 seeded faults in ten open-source Java programs. We empirically compare Multric against four widely-studied metrics and three recently-proposed one.

Pinso: Precise Isolation of Concurrency Bugs via Delta Triaging,B. Liu; Z. Qi; B. Wang; R. Ma,"Dept. of Comput.

These programs often fail because of concurrency bugs caused by non-deterministic interleavings among shared memory accesses. Even though a concurrency bug can be detected, it is still hard to isolate the root cause of the bug, due to the challenge in understanding the complex thread interleavings or schedules. In this paper, we propose a practical and precise isolation technique for concurrent bugs called Pinso that seeks to exploit the non-deterministic nature of concurrency bugs and accurately find the root causes of program error, to further help developers maintain concurrent programs. Pinso profiles runtime inter-thread interleavings based on a set of summarized memory access patterns, and then, isolates suspicious interleaving patterns in the triaging phase. Using a filtration-oriented scheduler, Pinso effectively eliminates false positives that are irrelevant to the bug. We evaluate Pinso with 11 real-world concurrency bugs, including single- and multi-variable violation, from sever/desktop concurrent applications (MySQL, Apache, and several others).

Quantifying the Encapsulation of Implemented Software Architectures,E. Bouwers; A. v. Deursen; J.

In the evaluation of implemented software architectures, metrics can be used to provide an indication of the degree of encapsulation within a system and to serve as a basis for an informed discussion about how well-suited the system is for expected changes. Current literature shows that over 40 different architecture-level metrics are available to quantify the encapsulation, but empirical validation of these metrics against changes in a system is not available. In this paper we investigate twelve existing architecture metrics for their ability to quantify the encapsulation of an implemented architecture. We correlate the values of the metrics against the ratio of local change over time using the history of ten open-source systems. In the design of our experiment we ensure that the values of the existing metrics are representative for the time period which is analyzed.

With this focus, we performed a study that compared the bug-proneness of the major clone-types: Type 1, Type 2, and Type 3. According to our experimental results on thousands of revisions of seven diverse subject systems, Type 3 clones exhibit the highest bug-proneness among the three clone-types. The bug-proneness of Type 1 clones is the lowest. Also, Type 3 clones have the highest likeliness of being co-changed consistently while experiencing bug-fixing changes. Moreover, the Type 3 clones that experience bug-fixes have a higher possibility of evolving following a Similarity Preserving Change Pattern (SPCP) compared to the bug-fix clones of the other two clone-types.

Despite several studies finding them common in production code, their formation, identification, and overall structure are not well understood, partly because of challenges in approximating true dependences between program entities. Previous research has considered two approximate dependence relations: a fine-grained statement-level relation using control and data dependences from a program's System Dependence Graph and a coarser relation based on function-level control-flow reachability. In principal, the first is more expensive and more precise than the second. Using a collection of twenty programs, we present an empirical investigation of the clusters identified by these two approaches. In support of the analysis, we consider a hybrid cluster type that works at the coarser function-level but is based on the higher-precision statement-level dependences. The three types of clusters are compared based on their slice sets using two clustering metrics. We also perform extensive analysis of the programs to identify linchpin functions - functions primarily responsible for holding a cluster together.

These sequences are composed of small code transformations (e.g., create a class, move a method) which are repeatedly applied to groups of related entities (e.g., a class and some of its methods). A typical example consists in the systematic introduction of a Factory design pattern on the classes of a package. We define these sequences as transformation patterns. In this paper, we identify examples of transformation patterns in real world software systems and study their properties: (i) they are specific to a system; (ii) they were applied manually; (iii) they were not always applied to all the software entities which could have been transformed; (iv) they were sometimes complex; and (v) they were not always applied in one shot but over several releases. These results suggest that transformation patterns could benefit from automated support in their application. From this study, we propose as future work to develop a macro recorder, a tool with which a developer records a sequence of code transformations and then automatically applies them in other parts of the system as a customizable, large-scale transformation operator.",,Electronic:978-1-4673-7532-0; USB:978-1-4673-7531-3,10.1109/ICSM.2015.7332468,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7332468,Code Transformation;Rearchitecting;Refactoring Tools;Restructuring;Software Maintenance,Computer architecture;Context;Maintenance engineering;Production facilities;Software systems;Systematics,software maintenance;source code (software),code change sequence;evolution;macro recorder;software system;source code transformation;system specific transformation;transformation operator,,2,,32,,,,Sept. 29 2015-Oct. 1 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,9

Parc uses previous code examples together with contextual and static type analysis to recommend method parameters. Evaluating our technique against the only available state-of-the-art tool using a number of subject systems and different Java libraries shows that our approach has potential.

The adherence to more elaborate conventions, such as the use of noun and verbal phrases in names, is not checked. We present Nominal, a naming convention checking library for Java that allows the declarative specification of conventions regarding typography and the use of abbreviations and phrases. To test Nominal, and to investigate the extent to which developers follow conventions, we extract 3.5 million reference - field, formal argument and local variable - name declarations from 60 FLOSS projects and determine their adherence to two well-known Java naming convention guidelines that give developers scope to choose a variety of forms of name, and sometimes offer conflicting advice.

However, such factors have not been captured yet in bug prediction models which simply exploit product metrics or process metrics based on the number and type of changes or on the number of developers working on a software component. Previous studies have demonstrated that focused developers are less prone to introduce defects than non focused developers. According to this observation, software components changed by focused developers should also be less error prone than software components changed by less focused developers. In this paper we capture this observation by measuring the structural and semantic scattering of changes performed by the developers working on a software component and use these two measures to build a bug prediction model. Such a model has been evaluated on five open source systems and compared with two competitive prediction models: the first exploits the number of developers working on a code component in a given time period as predictor, while the second is based on the concept of code change entropy. The achieved results show the superiority of our model with respect to the two competitive approaches, and the complementarity of the defined scattering measures with respect to standard predictors commonly used in the literature.",,Electronic:978-1-4673-7532-0; USB:978-1-4673-7531-3,10.1109/ICSM.2015.7332470,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7332470,,Complexity theory;Computer bugs;Entropy;Measurement;Predictive models;Scattering;Software,human factors;program debugging;public domain software,bug prediction model;code change entropy;human-related factor;open source system;process metrics;product metrics;semantic scattering;software component,,1,,43,,,,Sept. 29 2015-Oct. 1 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,9

We study advantages and disadvantages of forking using the case of Marlin, an open source firmware for 3D printers. We find that many problems and advantages of cloning do translate to forking. Interestingly, the Marlin community uses both forking and integrated variability management (conditional compilation) to create variants and features. Thus, studying it increases our understanding of the choice between integrated and clone-based variant management. It also allows us to observe mechanisms governing source code maturation, in particular when, why and how feature implementations are migrated from forks to the main integrated platform.

Recent work has shown that code smells that appear together in the same file (i.e., collocated smells) can interact with each other, leading to various types of maintenance issues and/or to the intensification of negative effects. It has also been found that code smell interactions can occur across coupled files (i.e., coupled smells), with comparable negative effects as the interaction of same-file (collocated) smells. Different inter-smell relations have been described in previous work, yet only few studies have evaluated them empirically. This study attempts to replicate the findings from previous work on inter-smell relations by analyzing larger systems, and by including both industrial and open source ones. We also include the analysis of coupled smells in addition to collocated smells, to achieve a more complete picture of inter-smell relations.

CRs at Ericsson are divided into two types: Internal and External. Internal CRs are reported within the organization after the integration and system testing phase. External CRs are submitted by customers and caused mainly by field failures. We examine the proportion and severity of internal CRs and that of external CRs. A large number of external (and severe) CRs could indicate flaws in the testing phase. Failing to react quickly to external CRs, on the other hand, may expose Ericsson to fines and penalties due to the Working Level Agreements (WLA) that Ericsson has with its customers. Moreover, we contrast the time it takes to handle each type of CRs with the dual aim to understand the similarities and differences as well as the factors that impact the handling of each type of CRs.

Formiga is implemented as an IDE plugin, which allows it to recognize when project resources are updated and automatically update the build system accordingly. A controlled experiment was conducted to assess Formiga's ability to assist developers with build maintenance. Subjects responded to scenarios in which various forms of build maintenance and/or knowledge about deliverables and their contents were requested. Subjects completed eleven different build maintenance tasks in both an experimental condition using Formiga and a control condition using only conventional IDE services. The study used a balanced design relative to both task order and use of Formiga. This design also ensured that order balancing was not confounded with the subjects' level of Ant expertise. Formiga was shown to significantly reduce the time required to perform build maintenance while increasing the correctness with which it can be performed for both novice and experienced developers.",,Electronic:978-1-4673-7532-0; USB:978-1-4673-7531-3,10.1109/ICSM.2015.7332466,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7332466,,Complexity theory;Computer science;Electrical engineering;Libraries;Maintenance engineering;Runtime;Software,project management;software development management;software maintenance;source code (software),Ant build maintenance;Ant build system;Ant expertise;Formiga;IDE plugin;IDE services;build refactoring;control condition;dependency discovery tool;software project;source code,,3,,13,,,,Sept. 29 2015-Oct. 1 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,9

When one system (e.g., a framework) evolves, its clients often need to adapt. Client developers might need to adapt to functionalities, client systems might need to be adapted to a new API, client users might need to adapt to a new User Interface. The consequences of such changes are yet unclear, what proportion of the ecosystem might be expected to react, how long might it take for a change to diffuse in the ecosystem, do all clients react in the same way?

Do automatic refactorings improve maintainability? An industrial case study,G. Szﾇke; C. Nagy; P. Hegedｱs; R. Ferenc; T.

Studies show that refactoring is indeed an elemental part of the developers' arsenal. However, empirical studies about the impact of refactorings on software maintainability still did not reach a consensus. Moreover, most of these empirical investigations are carried out on open-source projects where distinguishing refactoring operations from other development activities is a challenge in itself. We had a chance to work together with several software development companies in a project where they got extra budget to improve their source code by performing refactoring operations. Taking advantage of this controlled environment, we collected a large amount of data during a refactoring phase where the developers used a (semi)automatic refactoring tool. By measuring the maintainability of the involved subject systems before and after the refactorings, we got valuable insights into the effect of these refactorings on large-scale industrial projects. All but one company, who applied a special refactoring strategy, achieved a maintainability improvement at the end of the refactoring phase, but even that one company suffered from the negative impact of only one type of refactoring.",,Electronic:978-1-4673-7532-0; USB:978-1-4673-7531-3,10.1109/ICSM.2015.7332494,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7332494,ISO/IEC 25010;automatic refactoring;coding issues;software maintainability,Companies;Complexity theory;Encoding;Measurement;Object oriented modeling;Software systems,DP industry;project management;public domain software;software maintenance;source code (software),automatic refactoring;code erosion;industrial projects;open-source projects;software development companies;software evolution;software maintainability;source code,,1,,33,,,,Sept. 29 2015-Oct. 1 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,9

To investigate how developers balance fixing versus learning during debugging, we conducted the first empirical investigation of the interplay between production bias and information foraging.

Towards automating dynamic analysis for behavioral design pattern detection,A. De Lucia; V. Deufemia; C. Gravino; M.

Such a dynamic analysis requires the monitoring of the candidate instances at run-time through the execution of a set of test cases. However, the definition of such test cases is a time-consuming task if performed manually, even more, when the number of candidate instances is high and they include many false positives. In this paper we present the results of an empirical study aiming at assessing the effectiveness of dynamic analysis based on automatically generated test cases in behavioral design pattern detection. The study considered three behavioral design patterns, namely State, Strategy, and Observer, and three publicly available software systems, namely JHotDraw 5.1, QuickUML 2001, and MapperXML 1.9.7. The results show that dynamic analysis based on automatically generated test cases improves the precision of design pattern detection tools based on static analysis only. As expected, this improvement in precision is achieved at the expenses of recall, so we also compared the results achieved with automatically generated test cases with the more expensive but also more accurate results achieved with manually built test cases.

Delta extraction: An abstraction technique to comprehend why two objects could be related,N. Nitta; T.

However, when using a debugger, developers often encounter several types of cumbersome tasks and are often confused by the huge and complicated runtime information. To support such a debugger-based comprehension task, we propose an abstraction technique of runtime information, named delta, and present a delta extraction and visualization tool. Basically, a delta is defined for two linked objects in an object-oriented program's execution. It intuitively represents the reason why these objects could be related in the execution, and it can hide the details of how these objects were related. We have conducted experiments on four subject tasks from two real-world systems to evaluate how appropriately an extracted delta can answer the `why' question and how long the tool can reduce the working time to answer the question. The results show that each delta can successfully answer the question and a tens-of-minutes to one-hour debugger-based task can be reduced by extracting a delta.",,Electronic:978-1-4673-7532-0; USB:978-1-4673-7531-3,10.1109/ICSM.2015.7332452,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7332452,back-in-time debugging;debugger-based program comprehension;dynamic analysis;trace compression,Containers;Context;Debugging;Electronic mail;Java;Runtime;Visualization,object-oriented programming;program debugging,delta extraction;object-oriented program execution;source code;visualization tool,,1,,18,,,,Sept. 29 2015-Oct. 1 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,9

Using multiple clone-matching metrics, we evaluate the quality of the tools' reporting of the benchmark clones with respect to refactoring and automatic clone analysis use-cases. We compare these real-world results against our Mutation and Injection Framework, a synthetic benchmark, to reveal deeper understanding of the tools.

Who should review this change?: Putting text and file location analyses together for more accurate recommendations,X. Xia; D. Lo; X. Wang; X.

Modern Code Review (MCR), a lightweight and tool-based variant of conventional code review, is widely adopted in both open source and proprietary software projects. One challenge that impacts MCR is the assignment of appropriate developers to review a code change. Considering that there could be hundreds of potential code reviewers in a software project, picking suitable reviewers is not a straightforward task. A prior study by Thongtanunam et al. showed that the difficulty in selecting suitable reviewers may delay the review process by an average of 12 days. In this paper, to address the challenge of assigning suitable reviewers to changes, we propose a hybrid and incremental approach Tie which utilizes the advantages of both Text mIning and a filE location-based approach. To do this, Tie integrates an incremental text mining model which analyzes the textual contents in a review request, and a similarity model which measures the similarity of changed file paths and reviewed file paths. We perform a large-scale experiment on four open source projects, namely Android, OpenStack, QT, and LibreOffice, containing a total of 42,045 reviews.

Modeling changeset topics for feature location,C. S. Corley; K. L. Kashuda; N. A. Kraft,"The University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, USA",2015 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME),20151123,2015,,,71,80,"Feature location is a program comprehension activity in which a developer inspects source code to locate the classes or methods that implement a feature of interest. Many feature location techniques (FLTs) are based on text retrieval models, and in such FLTs it is typical for the models to be trained on source code snapshots. However, source code evolution leads to model obsolescence and thus to the need to retrain the model from the latest snapshot. In this paper, we introduce a topic-modeling-based FLT in which the model is built incrementally from source code history.

While previous studies either investigated licensing through mining software repositories or studied licensing through FOSS reuse, we aim at understanding the rationale behind developers' decisions for choosing or changing software licensing by surveying open source developers. In this paper, we analyze when developers consider licensing, the reasons why developers pick a license for their project, and the factors that influence licensing changes. Additionally, we explore the licensing-related problems that developers experienced and expectations they have for licensing support from forges (e.g., GitHub). Our investigation involves, on one hand, the analysis of the commit history of 16,221 Java open source projects to identify the commits where licenses were added or changed. On the other hand, it consisted of a survey-in which 138 developers informed their involvement in licensing-related decisions and 52 provided deeper insights about the rationale behind the actions that they had undertaken. The results indicate that developers adopt licenses early in the project's development and change licensing after some period of development (if at all). We also found that developers have inherent biases with respect to software licensing. Additionally, reuse-whether by a non-contributor or for commercial purposes-is a dominant reason why developers change licenses of their systems. Finally, we discuss potential areas of research that could ameliorate the difficulties that software developers are facing with regard to licensing issues of their software systems.",,Electronic:978-1-4673-7532-0; USB:978-1-4673-7531-3,10.1109/ICSM.2015.7332449,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7332449,Empirical Studies;Mining Software Repositories;Software Licenses,Data mining;History;Java;Law;Licenses;Software,Java;public domain software,FOSS reuse;Java open source project;software license;software repository mining,,8,,31,,,,Sept. 29 2015-Oct. 1 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,9
Query by example in large-scale code repositories,V. Balachandran,"VMware, Bangalore, India",2015 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME),20151123,2015,,,467,476,"Searching code samples in a code repository is an important part of program comprehension. Most of the existing tools for code search support syntactic element search and regular expression pattern search. However, they are text-based and hence cannot handle queries which are syntactic patterns. The proposed solutions for querying syntactic patterns using specialized query languages present a steep learning curve for users. The querying would be more user-friendly if the syntactic pattern can be formulated in the underlying programming language (as a sample code snippet) instead of a specialized query language. In this paper, we propose a solution for the query by example problem using Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) structural similarity match. The query snippet is converted to an AST, then its subtrees are compared against AST subtrees of source files in the repository and the similarity values of matching subtrees are aggregated to arrive at a relevance score for each of the source files. To scale this approach to large code repositories, we use locality-sensitive hash functions and numerical vector approximation of trees. Our experimental evaluation involves running control queries against a real project.

Code smells in spreadsheet formulas revisited on an industrial dataset,B. Jansen; F.

The smell detection algorithm used in this earlier study was validated on a small dataset of industrial spreadsheets by interviewing the users of these spreadsheets and asking them about their opinion about the found smells. In this paper a more in depth validation of the algorithm is done by analyzing a set of spreadsheets of which users indicated whether or not they are smelly. This new dataset gives us the unique possibility to get more insight in how we can distinguish `bad' spreadsheets from `good' spreadsheets. We do that in two ways: For both the smelly and non smelly spreadsheets we 1) have calculated the metrics that detect the smells and 2) have calculated metrics with respect to size, level of coupling, and the use of functions. The results show that indeed the metrics for the smells decrease in spreadsheets that are not smelly. With respect to size we found to our surprise that the improved spreadsheets were not smaller, but bigger. With regard to coupling and the use of functions both datasets are similar. It indicates that it is difficult to use metrics with respect to size, degree of coupling or use of functions to draw conclusions on the complexity of a spreadsheet.",,Electronic:978-1-4673-7532-0; USB:978-1-4673-7531-3,10.1109/ICSM.2015.7332488,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7332488,,Companies;Complexity theory;Couplings;Length measurement;Programming;Standards,software engineering;spreadsheet programs,code smell detection algorithm;industrial spreadsheet;spreadsheet formula,,4,,13,,,,Sept. 29 2015-Oct. 1 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,8
Efficient regression testing based on test history: An industrial evaluation,E. D. Ekelund; E.

The current automated regression test suite takes approximately seven hours to run which prevents developers from integrating code changes several times a day as preferred. Therefore we want to implement a highly selective yet accurate regression testing strategy. Traditional code coverage based techniques are not applicable due to the size and complexity of the software under test. Instead we decided to select tests based on regression test history. We developed a tool, the Difference Engine, which parses and analyzes results from previous test runs and outputs regression test recommendations. The Difference Engine correlates code and test cases at package level and recommends test cases that are strongly correlated to recently changed packages. We evaluated the technique with respect to correctness, precision, recall and efficiency. Our results are promising.

_巾Automated Debugging Considered Harmful_享 Considered Harmful: A User Study Revisiting the Usefulness of Spectra-Based Fault Localization Techniques with Professionals Using Real Bugs from Large Systems,X. Xia; L. Bao; D. Lo; S. Li,"Coll. of Comput. Sci. & Technol., Zhejiang Univ., Hangzhou, China",2016 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME),20170116,2016,,,267,278,"Due to the complexity of software systems, bugs are inevitable. Software debugging is tedious and time consuming. To help developers perform this crucial task, a number of spectra-based fault localization techniques have been proposed. In general, spectra-based fault localization helps developers to find the location of a bug given its symptoms (e.g., program failures). A previous study by Parnin and Orso however implies that several assumptions made by existing work on spectra-based fault localization do not hold in practice, which hinders the practical usage of these tools. Moreover, a recent study by Xie et al. claims that spectra-based fault localization can potentially ""weaken programmers' abilities in fault detection"".Unfortunately, these studies are performed either using only 2 bugs from small systems (Parnin and Orso's study) or synthetic bugs injected into toy programs (Xie et al.'s study), only involve students, and use dated spectra-based fault localization tools. Thus, the question whether spectra-based fault localization techniques can help professionals to improve their debugging efficiency in a reasonably large project is still insufficiently answered. In this paper, we perform a more realistic investigation of how professionals can use and benefit from spectra-based fault localization techniques. We perform a user study of spectra-based fault localization with a total of 16 real bugs from 4 reasonably large open-source projects, with 36 professionals, amounting to 80 recorded debugging hours. The 36 professionals are divided into 3 groups, i.e., those that use an accurate fault localization tool, use a mediocre fault localization tool, and do not use any fault localization tool. Our study finds that both the accurate and mediocre spectra-based fault localization tools can help professionals to save their debugging time, and the improvements are statistically significant and substantial. We also discuss implications of our findings to future dire- tions of spectra-based fault localization.",,Electronic:978-1-5090-3806-0; POD:978-1-5090-3807-7,10.1109/ICSME.2016.67,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7816473,Automated Debugging;Empirical Study;Spectra-Based Fault Localization;User Study,Computer bugs;Debugging;Java;Open source software;Outsourcing;Software maintenance,program debugging;program diagnostics;public domain software;software fault tolerance;software tools,debugging time;fault detection;mediocre spectra-based fault localization tools;open-source projects;program failures;software debugging;software system complexity,,4,,,,,,2-7 Oct. 2016,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,11
A Comprehensive Study on the Energy Efficiency of Java_祇s Thread-Safe Collections,G. Pinto; K. Liu; F. Castor; Y. D. Liu,"IFPA, Brazil",2016 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME),20170116,2016,,,20,31,"Java programmers are served with numerous choices of collections, varying from simple sequential ordered lists to sophisticated hashtable implementations. These choices are well-known to have different characteristics in terms of performance, scalability, and thread-safety, and most of them are well studied. This paper analyzes an additional dimension, energy efficiency. We conducted an empirical investigation of 16 collection implementations (13 thread-safe, 3 non-thread-safe) grouped under 3 commonly used forms of collections (lists, sets, and mappings). Using micro-and real world-benchmarks (Tomcat and Xalan), we show that our results are meaningful and impactful. In general, we observed that simple design decisions can greatly impact energy consumption. In particular, we found that using a newer hashtable version can yield a 2.19x energy savings in the micro-benchmarks and up to 17% in the real world-benchmarks, when compared to the old associative implementation. Also, we observed that different implementations of the same thread-safe collection can have widely different energy consumption behaviors. This variation also applies to the different operations that each collection implements, e.g, a collection implementation that performs traversals very efficiently can be more than an order of magnitude less efficient than another implementation of the same collection when it comes to insertions.",,Electronic:978-1-5090-3806-0; POD:978-1-5090-3807-7,10.1109/ICSME.2016.34,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7816451,,Data structures;Energy consumption;Energy measurement;Java;Optimization;Programming;Servers,Java;energy conservation;object-oriented programming,Java programmers;Java thread-safe collections;Tomcat benchmark;Xalan benchmark;energy consumption;energy efficiency,,1,,,,,,2-7 Oct. 2016,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,11

It takes as input textual documents such as bug reports and feature requests and outputs a list of candidate code units that are relevant to the bug reports or feature requests. Many information retrieval (IR) based concern localization techniques have been proposed in the literature. These techniques typically represent code units and textual descriptions as a bag of tokens at one level of abstraction, e.g., each token is a word, or each token is a topic. In this work, we propose a multi-abstraction concern localization technique named MULAB. MULAB represents a code unit and a textual description at multiple abstraction levels. Similarity of a textual description and a code unit is now made by considering all these abstraction levels. We combine a vector space model and multiple topic models to compute the similarity and apply a genetic algorithm to infer semi-optimal topic model configurations.

Previous studies empirically assessed the impact of smells on code quality and clearly indicate their negative impact on maintainability, including a higher bug-proneness of components affected by code smells. In this paper we capture previous findings on bug-proneness to build a specialized bug prediction model for smelly classes. Specifically, we evaluate the contribution of a measure of the severity of code smells (i.e., code smell intensity) by adding it to existing bug prediction models and comparing the results of the new model against the baseline model. Results indicate that the accuracy of a bug prediction model increases by adding the code smell intensity as predictor.

This SDK comes with a set of APIs which developers may find limited in comparison to what system apps can do or what framework developers are preparing to harness capabilities of new generation devices. Thus, developers may attempt to explore in advance the normally ""inaccessible"" APIs for building unique API-based functionality in their app. The Android programming model is unique in its kind. Inaccessible APIs, which however are used by developers, constitute yet another specificity of Android development, and is worth investigating to understand what they are, how they evolve over time, and who uses them. To that end, in this work, we empirically investigate 17 important releases of the Android framework source code base, and we find that inaccessible APIs are commonly implemented in the Android framework, which are further neither forward nor backward compatible. Moreover, a small set of inaccessible APIs can eventually become publicly accessible, while most of them are removed during the evolution, resulting in risks for such apps that have leveraged inaccessible APIs.

Accuracy measures and cross validation is used for validating the estimation models.

Inferring Computational State Machine Models from Program Executions,N. Walkinshaw; M. Hall,"Dept. of Comput. Sci., Univ. of Leicester, Leicester, UK",2016 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME),20170116,2016,,,122,132,"The challenge of inferring state machines from log data or execution traces is well-established, and has led to the development of several powerful techniques. Current approaches tend to focus on the inference of conventional finite state machines or, in few cases, state machines with guards. However, these machines are ultimately only partial, because they fail to model how any underlying variables are computed during the course of an execution, they are not computational. In this paper we introduce a technique based upon Genetic Programming to infer these data transformation functions, which in turn render inferred automata fully computational. Instead of merely determining whether or not a sequence is possible, they can be simulated, and be used to compute the variable values throughout the course of an execution. We demonstrate the approach by using a Cross-Validation study to reverse-engineer complete (computational) EFSMs from traces of established implementations.",,Electronic:978-1-5090-3806-0; POD:978-1-5090-3807-7,10.1109/ICSME.2016.74,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7816460,Genetic Programming;Reverse Engineering;State Machines,Automata;Computational modeling;Data models;Genetic programming;Inference algorithms;Sociology;Training,finite state machines;genetic algorithms;program diagnostics;reverse engineering,computational state machine models;data transformation functions;finite state machines;fully computational automata;genetic programming;log data;program executions;reverse-engineer complete EFSM;state machines,,1,,,,,,2-7 Oct. 2016,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,10
Learning to Extract API Mentions from Informal Natural Language Discussions,D. Ye; Z. Xing; C. Y. Foo; J. Li; N. Kapre,"Sch. of Comput. Sci. & Eng., Nanyang Technol. Univ., Singapore, Singapore",2016 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME),20170116,2016,,,389,399,"When discussing programming issues on social platforms (e.g, Stack Overflow, Twitter), developers often mention APIs in natural language texts. Extracting API mentions in natural language texts is a prerequisite for effective indexing and searching for API-related information in software engineering social content. However, the informal nature of social discussions creates two fundamental challenges for API extraction: common-word polysemy and sentence-format variations. Common-word polysemy refers to the ambiguity between the API sense of a common word and the normal sense of the word (e.g., append, apply and merge). Sentence-format variations refer to the lack of consistent sentence writing format for inferring API mentions. Existing API extraction techniques fall short to address these two challenges, because they assume distinct API naming conventions (e.g., camel case, underscore) or structured sentence format (e.g., code-like phrase, API annotation, or full API name). In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised machine-learning approach that exploits name synonyms and rich semantic context of API mentions to extract API mentions in informal social text. The key innovation of our approach is to exploit two complementary unsupervised language models learned from the abundant unlabeled text to model sentence-format variations and to train a robust model with a small set of labeled data and an iterative self-training process. The evaluation of 1,205 API mentions of the three libraries (Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib) in Stack Overflow texts shows that our approach significantly outperforms existing API extraction techniques based on language-convention and sentence-format heuristics and our earlier machine-learning based method for named-entity recognition.",,Electronic:978-1-5090-3806-0; POD:978-1-5090-3807-7,10.1109/ICSME.2016.11,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7816484,,Context;Feature extraction;Joining processes;Libraries;Natural languages;Software engineering;Standards,application program interfaces;indexing;learning (artificial intelligence);natural languages;social networking (online);software engineering;text analysis,API mention extraction;API naming conventions;API-related information;common-word polysemy;indexing;informal natural language discussions;named-entity recognition;natural language texts;semisupervised machine-learning;sentence-format variations;social platforms;software engineering social content;stack overflow texts,,,,,,,,2-7 Oct. 2016,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,10
Who is Who in the Mailing List? Comparing Six Disambiguation Heuristics to Identify Multiple Addresses of a Participant,I. S. Wiese; J. T. d. Silva; I. Steinmacher; C. Treude; M. A. Gerosa,"Comput.

Researchers have been mining the history of such lists to study communities' behavior, organization, and evolution. A potential threat of this kind of study is that users often use multiple email addresses to interact in a single mailing list. This can affect the results and tools, when, for example, extracting social networks. This issue is particularly relevant for popular and long-term Open Source Software (OSS) projects, which attract participation of thousands of people. Researchers have proposed heuristics to identify multiple email addresses from the same participant, however there are few studies analyzing the effectiveness of these heuristics. In addition, many studies still do not use any heuristics for authors' disambiguation, which can compromise the results. In this paper, we compare six heuristics from the literature using data from 150 mailing lists from Apache Software Foundation projects. We found that the heuristics proposed by Oliva et al. and a Nai神ve heuristic outperformed the others in most cases, when considering the F-measure metric. We also found that the time window and the size of the dataset influence the effectiveness of each heuristic.

Evolving NoSQL Databases without Downtime,K. Saur; T. Dumitra; M.

Applications that use these databases will evolve over time, sometimes necessitating (or preferring) a change to the format or organization of the data. The problem we address in this paper is: How can we support the evolution of high-availability applications and their NoSQL data online, without excessive delays or interruptions, even in the presence of backward-incompatible data format changes? We present KVolve, an extension to the popular Redis NoSQL database, as a solution to this problem. KVolve permits a developer to submit an upgrade specification that defines how to transform existing data to the newest version. This transformation is applied lazily as applications interact with the database, thus avoiding long pause times. We demonstrate that KVolve is expressive enough to support substantial practical updates, including format changes to RedisFS, a Redis-backed file system, while imposing essentially no overhead in general use and minimal pause times during updates.",,Electronic:978-1-5090-3806-0; POD:978-1-5090-3807-7,10.1109/ICSME.2016.47,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7816464,,Arrays;Benchmark testing;Encoding;Relational databases;Servers;Software,SQL;formal specification;relational databases,KVolve extension;NoSQL database;Redis-backed file system;RedisFS;format change;software developer;upgrade specification,,1,,,,,,2-7 Oct. 2016,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,10
Understanding Variable Code: Reducing the Complexity by Integrating Variability Information,D. L神demann; N. Asad; K. Schmid; C.

An approach that has been proposed in the past to improve the understanding of code with preprocessor statements is formal concept analysis. This approach has been applied to a number of causes in reengineering. However, the lattices constructed by this approach can become rather large and complex. Hence, any approach that helps to reduce them can be beneficial to understanding the preprocessor-dependencies contained in the code. Here, we show how consistency analysis both within code variability and between code and a variability model can be used to reduce the complexity of a lattice, supporting the analysis of product-line code. We apply our approach to Linux, one of the largest open-source product lines, and analyze both multiple versions and different architectures. We show that our approach typically leads to reductions of the concept lattice and identify situations in which the savings can be rather significant.

Moreover, we also compared the predictive accuracy of seven models of programmer navigation from the literature, including ones based on navigation history and code-structural relationships. To address our research goals, we performed a controlled laboratory study of the navigation behavior of 10 participants engaged in software evolution tasks. The study was a partial replication of a previous comprehensive evaluation of predictive models by Piorkowski et al., and also served to test the generalizability of their results. Key findings of the study included that the click-based navigations agreed closely with those reported by human observers, whereas view-based navigations diverged significantly. Furthermore, our data showed that the predictive model based on recency was significantly more accurate than the other models, suggesting the strong potential for tools that leverage recency-type models.

ICON: Inferring Temporal Constraints from Natural Language API Descriptions,R. Pandita; K. Taneja; L. Williams; T. Tung,,2016 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME),20170116,2016,,,378,388,"Temporal constraints of an Application Programming Interface (API) are the allowed sequences of method invocations in the API governing the secure and robust operation of client software using the API.

Manually identifying and writing formal temporal constraints from API documents can be prohibitively time-consuming and error-prone. To address this issue, we propose ICON: an approach based on Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) for identifying and inferring formal temporal constraints. To evaluate our approach, we use ICON to infer and formalize temporal constraints from the Amazon S3 REST API, the PayPal Payment REST API, and the java.io package in the JDK API. Our results indicate that ICON can effectively identify temporal constraint sentences (from over 4000 human annotated API sentences) with the average 79.0% precision and 60.0% recall.

We present TLE (Trace Link Evolver), a solution for automating the evolution of trace links as changes are introduced to source code. We use a set of heuristics, open source tools, and information retrieval methods to detect common change scenarios across different versions of software. Each change scenario is then associated with a set of link evolution heuristics which are used to evolve trace links.

In this work, we conduct empirical studies on several open-source projects to investigate the use of well-defined semantics in programming languages to guide the translation process in SMT. We have investigated five types of features forming the contexts involving the (semantic) relations among code tokens including occurrence association among code tokens, data and control dependencies among program entities, visibility constraints of entities, and the consistency in declarations and accesses of variables, fields and methods. We use the Direct Maximum Entropy (DME) approach for feature integration. Our empirical results show that as individual features added to the baseline SMT model, token association and data dependencies contribute much with highest relative improvement in semantic correctness of up to 18.3% and 18.5%, respectively. The integration of three feature types (token association, data dependencies, and visibility) into the baseline model has highest relative improvement with up to 26.4% improvement in semantic correctness.

Why are Commits Being Reverted?: A Comparative Study of Industrial and Open Source Projects,J. Shimagaki; Y. Kamei; S. McIntosh; D. Pursehouse; N. Ubayashi,"Sony Mobile Commun. Inc., Japan",2016 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME),20170116,2016,,,301,311,"Software development is a cyclic process of integrating new features while introducing and fixing defects. During development, commits that modify source code files are uploaded to version control systems. Occasionally, these commits need to be reverted, i.e., the code changes need to be completely backed out of the software project. While one can often speculate about the purpose of reverted commits (e.g., the commit may have caused integration or build problems), little empirical evidence exists to substantiate such claims. The goal of this paper is to better understand why commits are reverted in large software systems. To that end, we quantitatively and qualitatively study two proprietary and four open source projects to measure: (1) the proportion of commits that are reverted, (2) the amount of time that commits that are eventually reverted linger within a codebase, and (3) the most frequent reasons why commits are reverted. Our results show that 1%-5% of the commits in the studied systems are reverted. Those commits that are eventually reverted linger within the studied codebases for 1-35 days (median). Furthermore, we identify 13 common reasons for reverting commits, and observe that the frequency of reverted commits of each reason varies broadly from project to project. A complementary qualitative analysis suggests that many reverted commits could have been avoided with better team communication and change awareness. Our findings made Sony Mobile's stakeholders aware that internally reverted commits can be reduced by paying more attention to their own changes. On the other hand, externally reverted commits could be minimized only if external stakeholders are involved to improve inter-company communication or requirements elicitation.",,Electronic:978-1-5090-3806-0; POD:978-1-5090-3807-7,10.1109/ICSME.2016.83,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7816476,code inspections;code review;mining software repository;revert;software evolution,Androids;Humanoid robots;Mobile communication;Mobile handsets;Software systems;Stakeholders,project management;public domain software;software engineering;software management;source code (software),industrial project;large software systems;open source project;qualitative analysis;reverted commits;software development;software project;source code;version control systems,,,,,,,,2-7 Oct. 2016,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,10

However, one of the main challenging tasks in modern code review is to find the most appropriate reviewers for submitted code changes. So far, reviewers assignment is still a manual, costly and time-consuming task.

RevRec aims at finding reviewers to be assigned for a code change based on their expertise and collaboration in past reviews using genetic algorithm (GA). We evaluated our approach on a benchmark of three open-source software systems, Android, OpenStack, and Qt. Results indicate that RevRec accurately recommends code reviewers with up to 59% of precision and 74% of recall.

Although performance tests often run for hours or days to uncover performance issues (e.g., memory leaks), much of the data that is generated during a performance test is repetitive. Performance analysts can stop their performance tests (to reduce the time to market and the costs of performance testing) if they know that continuing the test will not provide any new information about the system's performance. To assist performance analysts in deciding when to stop a performance test, we propose an automated approach that measures how much of the data that is generated during a performance test is repetitive. Our approach then provides a recommendation to stop the test when the data becomes highly repetitive and the repetitiveness has stabilized (i.e., little new information about the systems' performance is generated). We performed a case study on three open source systems (i.e., CloudStore, PetClinic and Dell DVD Store). Our case study shows that our approach reduces the duration of 24-hour performance tests by 75% while preserving more than 91.9% of the information about the system's performance. In addition, our approach recommends a stopping time that is close to the most cost-effective stopping time (i.e., the stopping time that minimize the duration of the test and maximizes the amount of information about the system's performance provided by performance testing).",,Electronic:978-1-5090-3806-0; POD:978-1-5090-3807-7,10.1109/ICSME.2016.46,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7816474,Performance Analysts;Performance Counters Data;Performance Testing;Software Engineering,Market research;Radiation detectors;Software maintenance;Software systems;System performance;Testing;Time factors,software maintenance;software performance evaluation,large-scale software systems;performance test;software maintenance;stopping time,,1,,,,,,2-7 Oct. 2016,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,10

In recent years, Hadoop ecosystem has been widely adopted as an evolving solution. This paper presents the migration of a legacy data analytics application in a provincial data center.

Beyond the architecture re-design, we focus on the problem of data model transformation from relational database to NoSQL database. We propose a query-aware approach to free developers from tedious manual work. The approach generates query-specific views (NoView) for NoSQL and re-structures the views to align with NoSQL's data model.

However, understanding, maintaining, and evolving code with such annotations is difficult, mainly because a developer has to work with all variants at a time. Dedicated methods and tools that allow working on a subset of all variants could ease the engineering of highly configurable software. We investigate the potential of one kind of such tools: projection-based variation control systems. For such systems we aim to understand: (i) what end-user operations they need to support, and (ii) whether they can realize the actual evolution of real-world, highly configurable software. We conduct an experiment that investigates variability-related evolution patterns and that evaluates the feasibility of a projection-based variation control system by replaying parts of the history of a highly configurable real-world 3D printer firmware project.

Recommending Code Changes for Automatic Backporting of Linux Device Drivers,F. Thung; X. B. D. Le; D. Lo; J. Lawall,"Sch. of Inf. Syst., Singapore Manage. Univ., Singapore, Singapore",2016 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME),20170116,2016,,,222,232,"Device drivers are essential components of any operating system (OS). They specify the communication protocol that allows the OS to interact with a device. However, drivers for new devices are usually created for a specific OS version. These drivers often need to be backported to the older versions to allow use of the new device. Backporting is often done manually, and is tedious and error prone. To alleviate this burden on developers, we propose an automatic recommendation system to guide the selection of backporting changes. Our approach analyzes the version history for cues to recommend candidate changes. We have performed an experiment on 100 Linux driver files and have shown that we can give a recommendation containing the correct backport for 68 of the drivers. For these 68 cases, 73.5%, 85.3%, and 88.2% of the correct recommendations are located in the Top-1, Top-2, and Top-5 positions of the recommendation lists respectively. The successful cases cover various kinds of changes including change of record access, deletion of function argument, change of a function name, change of constant, and change of if condition.

A Complete Operator Library for DSL Evolution Specification,J. G. M. Mengerink; A. Serebrenik; R. R. H. Schiffelers; M. G. J. v. d. Brand,"Eindhoven Univ. of Technol., Eindhoven, Netherlands",2016 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME),20170116,2016,,,144,154,"Domain-specific languages (DSLs) allow users to model systems using concepts from a specific domain. Evolution of DSLs triggers co-evolution of models developed in these languages. Manual co-evolution of the thousands of models is unfeasible, calling for an automated support. A prerequisite to automating model co-evolution with respect to DSL evolution is the ability to formally specify DSL evolution, e.g., using predefined evolution operators. Success or failure of the practical application of the operator-based approach therefore depends heavily on the operators offered by the operator library at hand. In this paper we evaluate the completeness of the state-of-the-art operator library claimed to be ""practically complete"" (which we denote as H) by using it to specify evolution of an ecosystem of 22 commercial DSLs over the period of four years. We observe that 11% of the changes cannot be specified. However, there is no guarantee that extending the library with the identified deficiencies will be sufficient to specify evolution of other DSLs. To mitigate this, we design a theoretically complete library of operators, R. We observe that 77% of the operators from R are absent from H. Of the deficiencies in H, 72% could not be revealed by means of studying the extensive industrial ecosystem above. Our study suggests that the existing operator libraries are not extensive enough to specify evolution of large model-driven software ecosystems.

Despite its relatively simple syntax, the language has a number of complex features like inheritance, cascading and specificity, which make CSS code challenging to understand and maintain. It has been noted in prior research that CSS code is prone to contain code smells which indicate design weaknesses and maintainability issues. In this paper we focus on one of those code smells called undoing style. It happens when a property is set to a value A, then overridden to another value B, possibly multiple times, and then set back to the original value of A. We refer to this pattern as the A?B*A pattern. We propose a technique that detects undoing style in CSS code and recommends refactoring opportunities to eliminate instances of undoing style while preserving the semantics of the web application. We evaluate our technique on 41 real-world web applications, and outline a proof of correctness for our refactoring. Our findings show that undoing style is quite prominent in CSS code.

The key challenge is to understand the underlying specification implemented by the software system. Regaining this understanding is more difficult when the source code is the only reliable source of information, documentation is outdated or only present in fragments, and original developers are not available anymore. Unfortunately, we encounter such situations frequently for scientific and engineering software systems, developed in industry. For instance, process models in the steelmaking domain are developed and maintained over decades by single engineers. If such an engineer leaves the company, he/she literally leaves behind a legacy system for another person (or team). We propose tool support combining static and dynamic program analysis to tackle this challenge. Using static program analysis we extract the input/output behavior from program source code and present the extracted information besides the analyzed source code, providing seamless navigation between both views. Dynamic program analysis allows developers to examine input/output behavior for single program executions and thereby gain insight into standard behavior and exceptional cases.

We chose the feature location algorithms because they are simple to explain, deploy and maintain as a project evolves and personnel rotate on and off. We tested both feature location algorithms against a large software system with a development lifespan of over 20 years. We compared both algorithms by surveying our industrial partner about the accuracy of the list of function points produced by each algorithm. To provide further evidence, we compared both algorithms against an open source benchmarking dataset. Finally, we discuss the requirements of the industrial environment and the ways in which it differs from the academic environment. Our industrial partner elected to use Lucene combined with the PageRank algorithm as their feature location algorithm because it balanced accuracy with simplicity.",,Electronic:978-1-5090-3806-0; POD:978-1-5090-3807-7,10.1109/ICSME.2016.76,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7816508,Feature Location;Function Points;Industry,Algorithm design and analysis;Complexity theory;Context;Estimation;Heuristic algorithms;Software;Software algorithms,production engineering computing;public domain software;search engines;software cost estimation;systems analysis,PageRank algorithm;automated feature location;industrial cost estimation;large software system;open source benchmarking dataset;program requirement mapping;software cost estimator,,2,,,,,,2-7 Oct. 2016,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,9
Customized Regression Testing Using Telemetry Usage Patterns,J. Anderson; H. Do; S. Salem,"Microsoft, North Dakota State Univ., Fargo, ND, USA",2016 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME),20170116,2016,,,572,581,"Pervasive telemetry in modern applications is providing new possibilities in the application of regression testing techniques. Similar to how research in bioinformatics is leading to personalized medicine, tailored to individuals, usage telemetry in modern software allows for custom regression testing, tailored to the usage patterns of an installation. By customizing regression testing based on software usage, the effectiveness of regression testing techniques can be greatly improved, leading to reduced testing costs and enhanced detection of defects that are most important to that customer. In this research, we introduce the concept of fingerprinting software usage patterns through telemetry. We provide various algorithms tocompute fingerprints and conduct an empirical study that shows that fingerprints are effective in identifying distinct usage patterns.

As an example, material scientists often capture their knowledge in the form of simulation software that contains sophisticated algorithms representing complex physical concepts. Since software engineering is typically not a core skill of these scientists, there is a risk that their software becomes unmaintainable once it reaches a substantial size or structural complexity. This paper reports on a case study in which software engineers consulted magnetics researchers in refactoring their simulation software. This software had grown to 30 kloc of Java and was considered unmaintainable by the stakeholders of the research project. The case study describes the process of refactoring a system under the guidance of a software engineer with results supported by static analysis and software metrics. It shows how software engineers evaluated and selected refactorings to apply to the system using their expert judgment with input from static analysis tools and discusses the outcome of refactoring as evaluated by code owners and reported via static analysis metrics.",,Electronic:978-1-5090-3806-0; POD:978-1-5090-3807-7,10.1109/ICSME.2016.52,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7816501,,Complexity theory;Graphical user interfaces;Java;Magnetics;Software;Software engineering;Windings,program diagnostics;software maintenance;software metrics,Java;code maintainability;simulation software;software engineering;software metrics;software refactoring;static analysis,,,,,,,,2-7 Oct. 2016,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,8
SimEvo: Testing Evolving Multi-process Software Systems,T. Yu,"Dept. of Comput.

However, most existing techniques for regression testing focus exclusively on single-process applications, but to date, no work has considered regression testing for software involving multiple processes or event handlers (e.g., software signals) at the system-level. The unique characteristics of concurrency control mechanism employed at the system-level can affect the static and dynamic analysis techniques on which existing regression testing approaches rely. Therefore, applying these approaches can result in inadequately tested software during maintenance, and ultimately impair software quality. In this paper, we propose SimEvo, the first regression testing techniques for multi-process applications. SimEvo employs novel impact analysis techniques to identify system-level concurrent events that are affected by the changes. It then reuses existing test cases, as well as generating new test cases, focused on the set of impacted events, to effectively and efficiently explore the newly updated concurrent behaviors.

An important prerequisite then is that test cases are deterministic. However, this is not always the case as some tests suffer from socalled flakiness. Flaky tests have serious consequences, as they can hide real bugs and increase software inspection costs. Existing research has focused on understanding the root causes of test flakiness and devising techniques to automatically fix flaky tests; a key area of investigation being concurrency. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between flaky tests and three previously defined test smells, namely Resource Optimism, Indirect Testing and Test Run War.We have set up a study involving 19,532 JUnit test methods belonging to 18 software systems. A key result of our investigation is that 54% of tests that are flaky contain a test code smell that can cause the flakiness.

By copying and pasting code with or without modification, developers reuse existing code to improve programming productivity. However, code clones present challenges to software maintenance: they may require consistent application of the same or similar bug fixes or program changes to multiple code locations. To simplify the maintenance process, various tools have been proposed to automatically detect clones [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]. Some tools tokenize source code, and then compare the sequence or frequency of tokens to reveal clones [1], [3], [4], [5]. Some other tools detect clones using tree-matching algorithms to compare the Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) of source code [2], [6]. In this paper, we present CCLEARNER, the first solely token-based clone detection approach leveraging deep learning. CCLEARNER extracts tokens from known method-level code clones and nonclones to train a classifier, and then uses the classifier to detect clones in a given codebase. To evaluate CCLEARNER, we reused BigCloneBench [7], an existing large benchmark of real clones. We used part of the benchmark for training and the other part for testing, and observed that CCLEARNER effectively detected clones. With the same data set, we conducted the first systematic comparison experiment between CCLEARNER and three popular clone detection tools.

Using Observed Behavior to Reformulate Queries during Text Retrieval-based Bug Localization,O. Chaparro; J. M. Florez; A. Marcus,"Univ. of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA",2017 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME),20171107,2017,,,376,387,"Text Retrieval (TR)-based approaches for bug localization rely on formulating an initial query based on a bug report. Often, the query does not return the buggy software artifacts at or near the top of the list (i.e., it is a low-quality query). In such cases, the query needs reformulation. Existing research on supporting developers in the reformulation of queries focuses mostly on leveraging relevance feedback from the user or expanding the original query with additional information (e.g., adding synonyms). In many cases, the problem with such lowquality queries is the presence of irrelevant terms (i.e., noise) and previous research has shown that removing such terms from the queries leads to substantial improvement in code retrieval. Unfortunately, the current state of research lacks methods to identify the irrelevant terms. Our research aims at addressing this problem and our conjecture is that reducing a low-quality query to only the terms describing the Observed Behavior (OB) can improve TR-based bug localization. To verify our conjecture, we conducted an empirical study using bug data from 21 open source systems to reformulate 451 low-quality queries. We compare the accuracy achieved by four TR-based bug localization approaches at three code granularities (i.e., files, classes, and methods), when using the complete bug reports as queries versus a reduced version corresponding to the OB only. The results show that the reformulated queries improve TR-based bug localization for all approaches by 147.4% and 116.6% on average, in terms of MRR and MAP, respectively.

Specifically, AimDroid applies an activity-insulated multi-level strategy during testing and replaying. It systematically discovers unexplored activities and then intensively exploits every discovered individual with a reinforcement learning guided random algorithm. We conduct comprehensive experiments on 50 popular closed-source commercial apps that in total have billions of daily usages in China.

An Exploratory Study of Performance Regression Introducing Code Changes,J. Chen; W. Shang,"Dept. of Comput. Sci. & Software Eng., Concordia Univ. - Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada",2017 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME),20171107,2017,,,341,352,"Performance is an important aspect of software quality. In fact, large software systems failures are often due to performance issues rather than functional bugs. One of the most important performance issues is performance regression. Examples of performance regressions are response time degradation and increased resource utilization. Although performance regressions are not all bugs, they often have a direct impact on users' experience of the system. Due to the possible large impact of performance regressions, prior research proposes various automated approaches that detect performance regressions. However, the detection of performance regressions is conducted after the fact, i.e., after the system is built and deployed in the field or dedicated performance testing environments. On the other hand, there exists rich software quality research that examines the impact of code changes on software quality; while a majority of prior findings do not use performance regression as a sign of software quality degradation. In this paper, we perform an exploratory study on the source code changes that introduce performance regressions. We conduct a statistically rigorous performance evaluation on 1,126 commits from ten releases of Hadoop and 135 commits from five releases of RxJava. In particular, we repetitively run tests and performance micro-benchmarks for each commit while measuring response time, CPU usage, Memory usage and I/O traffic. We identify performance regressions in each test or performance micro-benchmark if there exists statistically significant degradation with medium or large effect sizes, in any performance metric. We find that performance regressions widely exist during the development of both subject systems. By manually examining the issue reports that are associated with the identified performance regression introducing commits, we find that the majority of the performance regressions are introduced while fixing other bugs. In addition, we id- ntify six root-causes of performance regressions. 12.5% of the examined performance regressions can be avoided or their impact may be reduced during development. Our findings highlight the need for performance assurance activities during development.

Evaluating State-of-the-Art Free and Open Source Static Analysis Tools Against Buffer Errors in Android Apps,B. Aloraini; M. Nagappan,"Sch. of Comput.

Android is the dominant platform in mobile app markets, and enhancing its apps security is a considerable area of research. Android malware (introduced intentionally by developers) has been well studied and many tools are available to detect them. However, little attention has been directed to address vulnerabilities caused unintentionally by developers in Android apps. Static analysis has been one way to detect such vulnerabilities in traditional desktop and server side desktop. Therefore, our research aims at assessing static analysis tools that could be used by Android developers. Our preliminary analysis revealed that Buffer Errors are the most frequent type of vulnerabilities that threaten Android apps. Also, we found that Buffer Errors in Android apps have the highest risk on Android that affects data integrity, confidentiality, and availability. Our main study therefore tested whether state-of-the-art static analysis tools could detect Buffer Errors in Android apps. We investigated 6 static analysis tools that are designed to detect Buffer Errors. The study shows that the free and open source state-of-the-art static analysis tools do not efficiently discover Buffer Error vulnerabilities in Android apps. We analyzed the tools carefully to see why they could not discover Buffer Errors and found that the lack of semantic analysis capabilities, inapplicability to Android apps, and the gap between native code and other contexts were some of the reasons. Thus, we concluded that there is a need to build better free and open source static analysis tools for detecting Buffer Errors in Android apps.",,Electronic:978-1-5386-0992-7; POD:978-1-5386-0993-4,10.1109/ICSME.2017.77,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8094430,Android Security;Buffer Errors;Static Analysis Tools,Androids;Databases;Humanoid robots;Security;Software;Static analysis;Tools,Android (operating system);invasive software;mobile computing;program diagnostics;public domain software,Android applications;Android malware;buffer errors;data availability;data confidentiality;data integrity;free-open source static analysis tools;static analysis tools,,,,,,,,17-22 Sept. 2017,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,11
Supervised vs Unsupervised Models: A Holistic Look at Effort-Aware Just-in-Time Defect Prediction,Q. Huang; X. Xia; D. Lo,"Coll. of Comput. Sci. & Technol., Zhejiang Univ., Hangzhou, China",2017 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME),20171107,2017,,,159,170,"Effort-aware just-in-time (JIT) defect prediction aims at finding more defective software changes with limited code inspection cost. Traditionally, supervised models have been used; however, they require sufficient labelled training data, which is difficult to obtain, especially for new projects. Recently, Yang et al. proposed an unsupervised model (LT) and applied it to projects with rich historical bug data. Interestingly, they reported that, under the same inspection cost (i.e., 20 percent of the total lines of code modified by all changes), it could find more defective changes than a state-of-the-art supervised model (i.e., EALR). This is surprising as supervised models that benefit from historical data are expected to perform better than unsupervised ones. Their finding suggests that previous studies on defect prediction had made a simple problem too complex. Considering the potential high impact of Yang et al.'s work, in this paper, we perform a replication study and present the following new findings: (1) Under the same inspection budget, LT requires developers to inspect a large number of changes necessitating many more context switches. (2) Although LT finds more defective changes, many highly ranked changes are false alarms. These initial false alarms may negatively impact practitioners' patience and confidence. (3) LT does not outperform EALR when the harmonic mean of Recall and Precision (i.e., F1-score) is considered. Aside from highlighting the above findings, we propose a simple but improved supervised model called CBS. When compared with EALR, CBS detects about 15% more defective changes and also significantly improves Precision and F1-score. When compared with LT, CBS achieves similar results in terms of Recall, but it significantly reduces context switches and false alarms before first success.

Revisiting Turnover-Induced Knowledge Loss in Software Projects,M. Nassif; M. P. Robillard,"Sch. of Comput.

When a developer leaves the project, their knowledge may be lost if the other developers do not understand the design decisions made by the leaving developer. Understanding the source code written by leaving developers thus becomes a burden for their successors. In a previous paper, Rigby et al. reported on a case study of turnover-induced knowledge loss in two large projects, Chromium and a project at Avaya, using risk evaluation methods usually applied to financial systems. They found that the two projects were susceptible to large knowledge losses that are more than three times the average loss. We report on a replication of their study on the Chromium project, as well as seven other large and medium-sized open source projects.

Software developers add, remove and update test methods and test classes as part of the software development process as well as during the evolution phase, following the initial release. In this work we conduct a large scale study of 61 popular open source projects and report the relationships we have established between test maintenance, production code maintenance, and semantic changes (e.g, statement added, method removed, etc.). performed in developers' commits.We build predictive models, and show that the number of tests in a software project can be well predicted by employing code maintenance profiles (i.e., how many commits were performed in each of the maintenance activities: corrective, perfective, adaptive). Our findings also reveal that more often than not, developers perform code fixes without performing complementary test maintenance in the same commit (e.g., update an existing test or add a new one). When developers do perform test maintenance, it is likely to be affected by the semantic changes they perform as part of their commit.Our work is based on studying 61 popular open source projects, comprised of over 240,000 commits consisting of over 16,000,000 semantic change type instances, performed by over 4,000 software engineers.",,Electronic:978-1-5386-0992-7; POD:978-1-5386-0993-4,10.1109/ICSME.2017.9,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8094407,Human Factors;Mining Software Repositories;Predictive Models;Software Maintenance;Software Testing;Software metrics,Java;Maintenance engineering;Predictive models;Production;Semantics;Software;Tools,program testing;software development management;software maintenance;software quality,automatic testing;change type instances;code maintenance profiles;open source projects;production code maintenance;software developers;software development process;software engineers;software project;software quality;test maintenance,,,,,,,,17-22 Sept. 2017,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,11

We identify the key concepts and perceptions from practitioners, which we then validated via a survey of 162 additional practitioners.We find that practitioners are directly impacted by their perception of the complexity of the conflicting code, and may alter the timeline in which to resolve these conflicts, as well as the methods employed for conflict resolution based upon that initial perception. Practitioners' perceptions alter the impact of tools and processes that have been designed to preemptively and efficiently resolve merge conflicts.

Heterogeneous Defect Prediction Through Multiple Kernel Learning and Ensemble Learning,Z. Li; X. Y. Jing; X. Zhu; H.

Recently, several HDP methods have been proposed. However, these methods do not sufficiently incorporate the two characteristics of the defect prediction data: (1) data could be linearly inseparable, and (2) data could be highly imbalanced. These two data characteristics make it challenging to build an effective HDP model. In this paper, we propose a novel Ensemble Multiple Kernel Correlation Alignment (EMKCA) based approach to HDP, which takes into consideration the two characteristics of the defect prediction data. Specifically, we first map the source and target project data into high dimensional kernel space through multiple kernel leaning, where the defective and non-defective modules can be better separated. Then, we design a kernel correlation alignment method to make the data distribution of the source and target projects similar in the kernel space. Finally, we integrate multiple kernel classifiers with ensemble learning to relieve the influence caused by class imbalance problem, which can improve the accuracy of the defect prediction model. Consequently, EMKCA owns the advantages of both multiple kernel learning and ensemble learning.

By knowing more about a developer's activities and in particular by knowing when she is working on which activity, we would be able to provide better and more tailored tool support, thereby reducing developer effort.In our research we investigate the characteristics of these activities, whether they can be identified, and whether we can use this additional information to improve developer support for change tasks. We conducted two exploratory studies with a total of 21 software developers collecting data on activities in the lab and field. An empirical analysis of the data shows, amongst other results, that activities comprise a consistently small amount of code elements across all developers and tasks (approx. 8.7 elements).

Faced with continuous disclosure of software vulnerabilities, system administrators must prioritize their efforts, triaging the most critical vulnerabilities to address first. Many vulnerability scoring systems have been proposed, but they all require expert knowledge to determine intricate vulnerability metrics. In this paper, we propose a deep learning approach to predict multi-class severity level of software vulnerability using only vulnerability description. Compared with intricate vulnerability metrics, vulnerability description is the ""surface level"" information about how a vulnerability works. To exploit vulnerability description for predicting vulnerability severity, discriminative features of vulnerability description have to be defined. This is a challenging task due to the diversity of software vulnerabilities and the richness of vulnerability descriptions. Instead of relying on manual feature engineering, our approach uses word embeddings and a one-layer shallow Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to automatically capture discriminative word and sentence features of vulnerability descriptions for predicting vulnerability severity.

This leads to the question: How should a code review tool order the parts of a code change to best support the reviewer? We answer this question with a middle-range theory, which we generated inductively in a mixed methods study, based on interviews, an online survey, and existing findings from related areas.

Code cloning (i.e., creating code clones) is suspected to propagate temporarily hidden bugs from one code fragment to another. However, there is no study on the intensity of bug-propagation through code cloning.In this paper we present our empirical study on bug-propagation through code cloning. We define two clone evolution patterns that reasonably indicate bug propagation through code cloning. We first identify code clones that experienced bug-fix changes by analyzing software evolution history, and then determine which of these code clones evolved following the bug propagation patterns. According to our study on thousands of commits of four open-source subject systems written in Java, up to 33% of the clone fragments that experience bug-fix changes can contain propagated bugs. Around 28.57% of the bug-fixes experienced by the code clones can occur for fixing propagated bugs. We also find that near-miss clones are primarily involved with bug-propagation rather than identical clones. The clone fragments involved with bug propagation are mostly method clones. Bug propagation is more likely to occur in the clone fragments that are created in the same commit operation rather than in different commits.

To achieve this goal, we have developed a machine learning approach named TEDIOUS (TEchnical Debt IdentificatiOn System), which leverages various kinds of method-level features as independent variables, including source code structural metrics, readability metrics and, last but not least, warnings raised by static analysis tools. We assessed TEDIOUS on data from nine open source projects for which there are available tagged self-admitted technical debt instances, also comparing the performances of different machine learners. Results of the study indicate that TEDIOUS achieves, when recommending self-admitted technical debts within a single project, an average precision of about 50% and a recall of 52%. When predicting cross-projects, TEDIOUS improves, achieving an average precision of 67% and a recall of 55%.

Composite Software Diversification,S. Wang; P. Wang; D. Wu,"Coll. of Inf.

If a copy of the vulnerable software is available to attackers, they can compose their attack scripts and payloads by studying the sample copy and launch attacks on other copies of the same software in deployment. By transforming software into different forms before deployment, software diversification is considered as an effective mitigation of attacks originated from malicious binary analyses.Essentially, developing a software diversification transformation is nontrivial because it has to preserve the original functionality, provide strong enough unpredictability, and introduce negligible cost. Enlightened by research in other areas, we seek to apply different diversification transformations to the same program for a synergy effect such that the resulting hybrid transformations can have boosted diversification effects with modest cost. We name this approach the composite software diversification.Although the concept is straightforward, it becomes challenging when searching for satisfactory compositions of primitive transformations that maximize the synergy effect and make a balance between effectiveness and cost. In this work, we undertake an in-depth study and develop a reasonably well working selection strategy to find a transformation composition that performs better than any single transformation used in the composition.

This practice is called patch uplift. Patch uplift is risky, because patches that are rushed through the stabilization phase can end up introducing regressions in the code. This paper examines patch uplift operations at Mozilla, with the aim to identify the characteristics of uplifted patches that introduce regressions. Through statistical and manual analyses, we quantitatively and qualitatively investigate the reasons behind patch uplift decisions and the characteristics of uplifted patches that introduced regressions. Additionally, we interviewed three Mozilla release managers to understand organizational factors that affect patch uplift decisions and outcomes. Results show that most patches are uplifted because of a wrong functionality or a crash. Uplifted patches that lead to faults tend to have larger patch size, and most of the faults are due to semantic or memory errors in the patches.

Variability-aware program analysis techniques have been proposed to support developers in understanding code-level variability by analyzing the space of program variants. Such techniques are highly beneficial, e.g., when determining the impact of changes during maintenance and evolution. Two strategies have been proposed in the literature to make existing program analysis techniques variability-aware:(i) program analysis can be lifted by considering variability already in the parsing stage; or(ii) analysis can be delayed by considering and recovering variability only when needed. Both strategies have advantages and disadvantages, however, a systematic comparison is still missing. The contributions of this paper are an in-depth comparison of SPLLIFT and COACH, two existing approaches representing these two strategies, and an analysis and discussion of the trade-offs regarding precision and run-time performance.

Refactoring Asynchrony in JavaScript,K. Gallaba; Q. Hanam; A. Mesbah; I. Beschastnikh,"McGill Univ., Montreal, QC, Canada",2017 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME),20171107,2017,,,353,363,"JavaScript is a widely used programming language that makes extensive use of asynchronous computation, particularly in the form of asynchronous callbacks. These callbacks are used to handle tasks, from GUI events to network messages, in a non-blocking fashion. Asynchronous callbacks present developers with two challenges. First, JavaScript's try/catch error-handling mechanism is not sufficient for proper error handling in asynchronous contexts. In response, the JavaScript community has come to rely on the error-first protocol, an informal programming idiom that is not enforced or checked by the runtime. Second, JavaScript callbacks are frequently nested, making them difficult to handle (also known as callback hell). Fortunately, a recent language extension called promises provides an alternative to asynchronous callbacks. The adoption of promises, however, has been slow as refactoring existing code to use promises is a complex task. We present a set of program analysis techniques to detect instances of asynchronous callbacks and to refactor such callbacks, including callbacks with the error-first protocol, into promises. We implement our techniques in a tool called PROMISESLAND. We perform a manual analysis of four JavaScript applications to evaluate the tool's precision and recall, which are, on average, 100% and 83%, respectively. We evaluate PROMISESLAND on 21 large JavaScript applications, and find that PROMISESLAND (1) correctly refactors callbacks to promises, (2) outperforms a recent related refactoring technique, and (3) runs in under three seconds on all of our evaluation targets.",,Electronic:978-1-5386-0992-7; POD:978-1-5386-0993-4,10.1109/ICSME.2017.83,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8094435,Asynchrony;Callback;JavaScript;Promises;Refactoring,Computer languages;Libraries;Manuals;Programming;Protocols;Tools,Java;error handling;graphical user interfaces;object-oriented programming;program diagnostics;program verification;software maintenance,JavaScript applications;JavaScript callbacks;PROMISESLAND;asynchronous callbacks;asynchronous computation;callback hell;error-first protocol;error-handling mechanism;programming language,,,,,,,,17-22 Sept. 2017,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,10
Interaction-Based Tracking of Program Entities for Test Case Evolution,H. A. Nguyen; T. T. Nguyen; T. N. Nguyen; H. V. Nguyen,"Iowa State Univ., Ames, IA, USA",2017 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME),20171107,2017,,,433,443,"After changes are made to a system, developers typically perform regression testing to uncover the regression faults in previously existing functionality of the system. However, during software evolution, the program entities (i.e., classes/methods) realizing such functionality might be modified/replaced by other entities. Thus, in the new version, existing test cases containing obsolete class references or method calls might be broken or might not test the intended functionality. To repair the broken method calls in those test cases, for each obsolete class/method, a tester needs to find the corresponding entity that provides the same/similar function or has the same role in the new version. To automate that task, we present ITRACK, a novel tool for matching program entities across versions, which mainly relies on their interactions in the code. The key idea is that the role and functionality of an entity correlate with its interactions with other entities (e.g., how it uses or is used by others). Two entities in two versions are matched based on the similarity of their interactions with other entities in the respective versions via our novel iterative matching algorithm. Our empirical evaluation shows that ITRACK achieves from 84-99% accuracy in identifying the calls in previous test cases that need to be adapted in accordance with the replacements of entities and provide such matching to support repairing broken method calls.",,Electronic:978-1-5386-0992-7; POD:978-1-5386-0993-4,10.1109/ICSME.2017.43,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8094442,origin analysis;program differencing;tracking of program entities across versions,Collaboration;Conferences;Documentation;Software;Testing;Tools,program testing;regression analysis;software maintenance,ITRACK;fault regression;interaction;program entities tracking;regression testing;software evolution;test case evolution,,,,,,,,17-22 Sept. 2017,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,10
Detecting DOM-Sourced Cross-Site Scripting in Browser Extensions,J. Pan; X. Mao,"Coll. of Comput., Nat. Univ. of Defense Technol., Changsha, China",2017 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME),20171107,2017,,,24,34,"In recent years, with the advances in JavaScript engines and the adoption of HTML5 APIs, web applications begin to show a tendency to shift their functionality from the server side towards the client side, resulting in dense and complex interactions with HTML documents using the Document Object Model (DOM). As a consequence, client-side vulnerabilities become more and more prevalent. In this paper, we focus on DOM-sourced Cross-site Scripting (XSS), which is a kind of severe but not well-studied vulnerability appearing in browser extensions. Comparing with conventional DOM-based XSS, a new attack surface is introduced by DOM-sourced XSS where the DOM could become a vulnerable source as well besides common sources such as URLs and form inputs. To discover such vulnerability, we propose a detecting framework employing hybrid analysis with two phases.

Deep Green: Modelling Time-Series of Software Energy Consumption,S. Romansky; N. C. Borle; S. Chowdhury; A. Hindle; R. Greiner,"Dept. of Comput. Sci., Univ. of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada",2017 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME),20171107,2017,,,273,283,"Inefficient mobile software kills battery life. Yet, developers lack the tools necessary to detect and solve energy bugs in software. In addition, developers are usually tasked with the creation of software features and triaging existing bugs. This means that most developers do not have the time or resources to research, build, or employ energy debugging tools. We present a new method for predicting software energy consumption to help debug software energy issues. Our approach enables developers to align traces of software behavior with traces of software energy consumption. This allows developers to match run-time energy hot spots to the corresponding execution. We accomplish this by applying recent neural network models to predict time series of energy consumption given a software's behavior. We compare our time series models to prior state-of-the-art models that only predict total software energy consumption. We found that machine learning based time series based models, and LSTM based time series based models, can often be more accurate at predicting instantaneous power use and total energy consumption.",,Electronic:978-1-5386-0992-7; POD:978-1-5386-0993-4,10.1109/ICSME.2017.79,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8094428,energy;green mining;modelling;online model;profiling;software engineering,Energy consumption;Energy measurement;Hardware;Predictive models;Software;Time series analysis;Tools,energy consumption;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile computing;neural nets;power aware computing;program debugging;program diagnostics;time series,LSTM;battery life;deep green;energy debugging tools;machine learning;mobile software;run-time energy hot spots;software behavior tracing;time series models;total energy consumption;total software energy consumption,,,,,,,,17-22 Sept. 2017,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,10

This paper provides a first attempt to compare the CI processes and occurrences of build failures in 349 Java OSS projects and 418 projects from a financial organization, ING Nederland. Through the analysis of 34,182 failing builds (26% of the total number of observed builds), we derived a taxonomy of failures that affect the observed CI processes. Using cluster analysis, we observed that in some cases OSS and ING projects share similar build failure patterns (e.g., few compilation failures as compared to frequent testing failures), while in other cases completely different patterns emerge. In short, we explain how OSS and ING CI processes exhibit commonalities, yet are substantially different in their design and in the failures they report.",,Electronic:978-1-5386-0992-7; POD:978-1-5386-0993-4,10.1109/ICSME.2017.67,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8094420,Agile development;Build failures;Continuous Delivery;Continuous Integration,Data mining;Organizations;Servers;Software;Taxonomy;Testing;Tools,Java;financial data processing;project management;public domain software;software development management,ING CI processes;ING Nederland;ING projects;Java OSS projects;build failure patterns;continuous integration;financial organization perspective;frequent testing failures;open-source software projects;single industrial organization,,,,,,,,17-22 Sept. 2017,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,10

But development in companies also involves tight schedules, old habits, less-trained developers, or practical difficulties such as creating a test database. As a result, good testing practices are not always used as often as one might wish. With a major IT company, we are engaged in a project to understand developers testing behavior, and whether it can be improved. Some ideas are to promote testing by reducing test session length, or by running automatically tests behind the scene and send warnings to developers about the failing ones. Reports on developers testing habits in the literature focus on highly distributed open-source projects, or involve students programmers. As such they might not apply to our industrial, closed source, context. In this paper, we take inspiration from experiments of two papers of the literature to enhance our comprehension of the industrial environment. We report the results of a field study on how often the developers use tests in their daily practice, whether they make use of tests selection and why they do. Results are reinforced by interviews with developers involved in the study. The main findings are that test practice is in better shape than we expected; developers select tests ""ruthlessly"" (instead of launching an entire test suite); although they are not accurate in their selection, and; contrary to expectation, test selection is not influenced by the size of the test suite nor the duration of the tests.",,Electronic:978-1-5386-0992-7; POD:978-1-5386-0993-4,10.1109/ICSME.2017.68,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8094409,Case study;IT company;Interviews;Regression Test Selection,Companies;Interviews;Manuals;Open source software;Testing;Tools,DP industry;database management systems;program testing;public domain software;software quality,IT company;distributed open-source projects;test database;test practice;test selection;test session length;testing habits,,,,,,,,17-22 Sept. 2017,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,10
GEAS: Generic Adaptive Scheduling for High-Efficiency Context Inconsistency Detection,B. Guo; H. Wang; C. Xu; J. Lu,"State Key Lab. for Novel Software Technol., Nanjing Univ., Nanjing, China",2017 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME),20171107,2017,,,137,147,"Context-aware applications adapt their behavior based on collected contexts. However, contexts can be inaccurate due to sensing noise, which might cause applications to misbehave. One promising approach is to check contexts against consistency constraints at runtime, so as to detect context inconsistencies for applications and resolve them in time. The checking is typically immediate upon each collected context change. Such a scheduling strategy is intuitive for avoiding missing context inconsistencies in the detection, but may cause low-efficiency problems for heavy-workload checking scenarios, even if equipped with existing incremental or parallel constraint checking techniques. One may choose to check contexts in a batch way to increase the efficiency by reducing the number of constraint checking. However, this can easily cause missed context inconsistencies, denying the purpose of inconsistency detection. In this paper, we propose a novel scheduling strategy GEAS of two nice properties: (1) adaptively tuning the batch window to avoid missing any context inconsistency; (2) generic to checking techniques with no or little adjustment. We experimentally evaluated GEAS against the immediate strategy with existing constraint checking techniques. The experimental results show that GEAS achieved 143-645% efficiency improvement without missing any context inconsistency, while alternatives caused 39.2-65.3% loss of detected context inconsistencies.",,Electronic:978-1-5386-0992-7; POD:978-1-5386-0993-4,10.1109/ICSME.2017.10,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8094416,Context inconsistency;scheduling strategy;suspicious pair,Adaptation models;Context;Context modeling;Context-aware services;Sensors;Software;Tuning,constraint handling;program diagnostics;scheduling;ubiquitous computing,batch window;collected context change;context-aware applications;detected context inconsistencies;generic adaptive scheduling;heavy-workload checking scenarios;high-efficiency context inconsistency detection;incremental checking techniques;missed context inconsistencies;parallel constraint checking techniques;scheduling strategy GEAS,,,,,,,,17-22 Sept. 2017,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,10
An Empirical Study on the Removal of Self-Admitted Technical Debt,E. D. S. Maldonado; R. Abdalkareem; E. Shihab; A. Serebrenik,"Dept. of Comput. Sci. & Software Eng., Concordia Univ., Montreal, QC, Canada",2017 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME),20171107,2017,,,238,248,"Technical debt refers to the phenomena of taking shortcuts to achieve short term gain at the cost of higher maintenance efforts in the future. Recently, approaches were developed to detect technical debt through code comments, referred to as Self-Admitted Technical Debt (SATD). Due to its importance, several studies have focused on the detection of SATD and examined its impact on software quality. However, preliminary findings showed that in some cases SATD may live in a project for a long time, i.e., more than 10 years. These findings clearly show that not all SATD may be regarded as 'bad' and some SATD needs to be removed, while other SATD may be fine to take on.Therefore, in this paper, we study the removal of SATD. In an empirical study on five open source projects, we examine how much SATD is removed and who removes SATD? We also investigate for how long SATD lives in a project and what activities lead to the removal of SATD? Our findings indicate that the majority of SATD is removed and that the majority is self-removed (i.e., removed by the same person that introduced it). Moreover, we find that SATD can last between approx. 18-172 days, on median. Finally, through a developer survey, we find that developers mostly use SATD to track future bugs and areas of the code that need improvements. Also, developers mostly remove SATD when they are fixing bugs or adding new features. Our findings contribute to the body of empirical evidence on SATD, in particular, evidence pertaining to its removal.",,Electronic:978-1-5386-0992-7; POD:978-1-5386-0993-4,10.1109/ICSME.2017.8,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8094425,Mining Software Repositories;Self-Admitted Technical Debt;Source Code Quality,Computer bugs;Data mining;Electronic mail;Java;Licenses;Open source software,program debugging;project management;software development management;software maintenance;software quality,SATD;bug fixing;code comments;maintenance efforts;self-admitted technical debt;software quality;technical debt detection,,,,,,,,17-22 Sept. 2017,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,10
Recommending Framework Extension Examples,M. Asaduzzaman; C. K. Roy; K. A. Schneider; D. Hou,"Dept. of Comput.

To meet application specific requirements, the behavior of a framework needs to be customized via extension points. A common way of customizing framework behavior is by passing a framework related object as an argument to an API call. Such an object can be created by subclassing an existing framework class or interface, or by directly customizing an existing framework object. However, to do this effectively requires developers to have extensive knowledge of the framework's extension points and their interactions. To aid the developers in this regard, we propose and evaluate a graph mining approach for extension point management. Specifically, we propose a taxonomy of extension patterns to categorize the various ways an extension point has been used in the code examples. Our approach mines a large amount of code examples to discover all extension points and patterns for each framework class. Given a framework class that is being used, our approach aids the developer by following a two-step recommendation process. First, it recommends all the extension points that are available in the class. Once the developer chooses an extension point, our approach then discovers all of its usage patterns and recommends the best code examples for each pattern. Using five frameworks, we evaluate the performance of our two-step recommendation, in terms of precision, recall, and F-measure. We also report several statistics related to framework extension points.",,Electronic:978-1-5386-0992-7; POD:978-1-5386-0993-4,10.1109/ICSME.2017.80,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8094444,API;code example;extension pattern;extension point;framework;graph mining;recommender;reuse,Data mining;Java;Rendering (computer graphics);Search engines;Software;Taxonomy;Tools,application program interfaces;data mining;graph theory;object-oriented methods;software management;software reusability;source code (software),API call;code examples;extension patterns taxonomy;extension point management;framework behavior;framework object;graph mining approach;software framework extension;software reusability,,,,,,,,17-22 Sept. 2017,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,10
A Characterization Study of Repeated Bug Fixes,R. Yue; N. Meng; Q. Wang,"Key Lab. of High Confidence Software Technol. (, Peking Univ., Beijing, China",2017 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME),20171107,2017,,,422,432,"Programmers always fix bugs when maintaining software. Previous studies showed that developers apply repeated bug fixes-similar or identical code changes-to multiple locations. Based on the observation, researchers built tools to identify code locations in need of similar changes, or to suggest similar bug fixes to multiple code fragments. However, some fundamental research questions, such as what are the characteristics of repeated bug fixes, are still unexplored. In this paper, we present a comprehensive empirical study with 341,856 bug fixes from 3 open source projects to investigate repeated fixes in terms of their frequency, edit locations, and semantic meanings. Specifically, we sampled bug reports and retrieved the corresponding fixing patches in version history. Then we chopped patches into smaller fixes (edit fragments). Among all the fixes related to a bug, we identified repeated fixes using clone detection, and put a fix and its repeated ones into one repeated-fix group. With these groups, we characterized the edit locations, and investigated the common bug patterns as well as common fixes.Our study on Eclipse JDT, Mozilla Firefox, and LibreOffice shows that (1) 15-20% of bugs involved repeated fixes; (2) 73-92% of repeated-fix groups were applied purely to code clones; and (3) 39% of manually examined groups focused on bugs relevant to additions or deletions of whole if-structures.

Therefore, privacy-preserving data-sharing becomes an important topic in cross-company defect prediction (CCDP). In this context, the challenge is how to achieve a high privacy-preserving level while ensuring the utility of the shared privatized data for CCDP. CLIFF&MORPH is a recently proposed state-of-the-art privacy-preserving data-sharing algorithm for CCDP. It has been reported that the CLIFF&MORPH CCDP model produces a promising defect prediction performance. However, we find that ManualDown, a simple (unsupervised) module size model, built on the target projects has a comparable or even better defect prediction performance. Since ManualDown does not require any source project data to build the model, it is free of the privacy-preserving data-sharing challenges for CCDP. This means that, for practitioners, the motivation of applying privacy-preserving data-sharing algorithms to CCDP could not be well justified if the utility challenge is not addressed. We analyze the implications of our findings and outline the directions for future research.

The aim of this study is to estimate wasted time, caused by the Technical Debt interest during the software life-cycle. This study also investigates how practitioners perceive and estimate the impact of the negative consequences due to Technical Debt during the software development process.

The importance and originality of this study contributes and provides novel insights into the research on Technical Debt by quantifying the perceived interest and the negative effects it has on the software development life-cycle. The findings show that on average, 36% of all development time is estimated to be wasted due to Technical Debt; Complex Architectural Design and Requirement Technical Debt generates most negative effect; and that most time is wasted on understanding and/or measuring the Technical Debt.

However, as binaries are usually stripped before distribution, function information is indeed absent in most binaries. By far, identifying functions in stripped binaries remains a challenge. Recent research work proposes to recognize functions in binary code through machine learning techniques. The recognition model, including typical function entry point patterns, is automatically constructed through learning. However, we observed that as previous work only leverages syntax-level features to train the model, binary obfuscation techniques can undermine the pre-learned models in real-world usage scenarios. In this paper, we propose FID, a semantics-based method to recognize functions in stripped binaries. We leverage symbolic execution to generate semantic information and learn the function recognition model through well-performing machine learning techniques.FID extracts semantic information from binary code and, therefore, is effectively adapted to different compilers and optimizations. Moreover, we also demonstrate that FID has high recognition accuracy on binaries transformed by widely-used obfuscation techniques. We evaluate FID with over four thousand test cases.

Embroidery patches the known critical framework and kernel vulnerabilities in Android using both static and dynamic binary rewriting techniques. It transplants official patches (CVE source code patches) of known vulnerabilities to different devices by adopting heuristic matching strategies to deal with the code diversity introduced by Android fragmentation, and fulfills a complex dynamic memory modification to implement kernel vulnerabilities patching.

With the goal of helping researchers and practitioners - who design approaches supporting mobile testing - to understand developer's needs, we analyzed survey responses from 102 open source contributors to Android projects about their practices when performing testing. The survey focused on questions regarding practices and preferences of developers/testers in-the-wild for (i) designing and generating test cases, (ii) automated testing practices, and (iii) perceptions of quality metrics such as code coverage for determining test quality. Analyzing the information gleaned from this survey, we compile a body of knowledge to help guide researchers and professionals toward tailoring new automated testing approaches to the need of a diverse set of open source developers.",,Electronic:978-1-5386-0992-7; POD:978-1-5386-0993-4,10.1109/ICSME.2017.47,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8094467,,Androids;Humanoid robots;Manuals;Mobile communication;Programming;Testing;Tools,Android (operating system);mobile computing;program testing,Android applications;automated testing approaches;automated testing practices;mobile applications;mobile developers;mobile testing;open source developers;test quality,,1,,,,,,17-22 Sept. 2017,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,9
RCIA: Automated Change Impact Analysis to Facilitate a Practical Cancer Registry System,S. Wang; T. Schwitalla; T. Yue; S. Ali; J. F. Nyg蝉rd,"Simula Res. Lab., Oslo, Norway",2017 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME),20171107,2017,,,603,612,"The Cancer Registry of Norway (CRN) employs a cancer registry system to collect cancer patient data (e.g., diagnosis and treatments) from various medical entities (e.g., clinic hospitals). The collected data are then checked for validity (i.e., validation) and assembled as cancer cases (i.e., aggregation) based on more than 1000 cancer coding rules in the system. However, it is frequent in practice that the collected cancer data changes due to various reasons (e.g., different treatments) and the cancer coding rules can also change/evolve due to new medical knowledge. Thus, such a cancer registry system requires an efficient means to automatically analyze these changes and provide consequent impacts to medical experts for further actions. This paper proposes an automated Rule-based Change Impact Analysis (CIA) approach named RCIA that includes: 1) a change classification to capture the potential changes that can occur at CRN; 2) in total 80 change impact analysis rules including 50 dependency rules and 30 impact rules; and 3) an efficient algorithm to analyze changes and produce consequent impacts. We evaluate RCIA via a case study with 12 real change sets from CRN and a conducted interview. The results showed that RCIA managed to produce 100% actual change impacts and the medical expert at CRN is quite positive to apply RCIA to facilitate their cancer registry system. We also shared a set of lessons learned based on the collaboration with CRN.",,Electronic:978-1-5386-0992-7; POD:978-1-5386-0993-4,10.1109/ICSME.2017.22,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8094466,cancer coding rules;cancer registry system;change classification;change impact analysis,Cancer;Encoding;Hospitals;Manuals;Medical diagnostic imaging;Surgery;Systematics,cancer;data analysis;data mining;expert systems;knowledge based systems;medical information systems;patient diagnosis;pattern classification,CRN;RCIA;automated change impact analysis;cancer patient data;cancer registry system;change classification;medical expert;rule-based change impact analysis,,,,,,,,17-22 Sept. 2017,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,9
Coarse Hierarchical Delta Debugging,R. Hodov錐n; 吹. Kiss; T.

It can be used as a test case simplification algorithm in its own right if theoretical minimality is not a strict requirement, or it can act as a preprocessing step to the original Hierarchical Delta Debugging algorithm. Evaluation of artificial and real test cases shows that a coarse variant can produce reduced test cases with significantly fewer testing steps than the original algorithm (58% gain on average, 79% maximum), while still keeping the outputs acceptably small (never increasing the reduced test cases by more than 0.36% of the input).",,Electronic:978-1-5386-0992-7; POD:978-1-5386-0993-4,10.1109/ICSME.2017.26,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8094421,coarse algorithm;hierarchical delta debugging;test case reduction,Computer crashes;Debugging;Grammar;Minimization;Software algorithms;Syntactics;Testing,data structures;program debugging;program testing,Coarse Hierarchical Delta Debugging algorithm;artificial test cases;efficient test case reduction;preprocessing step;real test cases;theoretical minimality,,,,,,,,17-22 Sept. 2017,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,9
Predicting and Evaluating Software Model Growth in the Automotive Industry,J. Schroeder; C. Berger; A. Knauss; H. Preenja; M. Ali; M. Staron; T. Herpel,"Dept. of Comput. Sci. & Eng., Chalmers & Univ. of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden",2017 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME),20171107,2017,,,584,593,"The size of a software artifact influences the software quality and impacts the development process. In industry, when software size exceeds certain thresholds, memory errors accumulate and development tools might not be able to cope anymore, resulting in a lengthy program start up times, failing builds, or memory problems at unpredictable times. Thus, foreseeing critical growth in software modules meets a high demand in industrial practice. Predicting the time when the size grows to the level where maintenance is needed prevents unexpected efforts and helps to spot problematic artifacts before they become critical. Although the amount of prediction approaches in literature is vast, it is unclear how well they fit with prerequisites and expectations from practice. In this paper, we perform an industrial case study at an automotive manufacturer to explore applicability and usability of prediction approaches in practice. In a first step, we collect the most relevant prediction approaches from literature, including both, approaches using statistics and machine learning. Furthermore, we elicit expectations towards predictions from practitioners using a survey and stakeholder workshops. At the same time, we measure software size of 48 software artifacts by mining four years of revision history, resulting in 4,547 data points. In the last step, we assess the applicability of state-of-the-art prediction approaches using the collected data by systematically analyzing how well they fulfill the practitioners' expectations. Our main contribution is a comparison of commonly used prediction approaches in a real world industrial setting while considering stakeholder expectations. We show that the approaches provide significantly different results regarding prediction accuracy and that the statistical approaches fit our data best.",,Electronic:978-1-5386-0992-7; POD:978-1-5386-0993-4,10.1109/ICSME.2017.41,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8094464,machine learning;measurement;model-based-software;prediction;software size;time series,Automotive engineering;Complexity theory;Mathematical model;Measurement;Predictive models;Software;Time series analysis,automobile industry;automobile manufacture;data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);production engineering computing;software metrics;software quality;statistical analysis,automotive industry;automotive manufacturer;machine learning;mining;prediction approaches;software artifact;software development process;software model growth;software modules;software quality;software size;statistics,,,,,,,,17-22 Sept. 2017,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,9
Graph Data Management of Evolving Dependency Graphs for Multi-versioned Codebases,O. Goonetilleke; D. Meibusch; B. Barham,"Oracle Labs., Brisbane, QLD, Australia",2017 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME),20171107,2017,,,574,583,"Frappe吹 is a code comprehension tool developed by Oracle Labs that extracts the code dependencies from a codebase and stores them in a graph database enabling advanced comprehension tasks. In addition to traditional text-based queries, such context-sensitive tools allow developers to express navigational queries of the form Does function X or something it calls write to global variable Y? providing more insight into the underlying codebases. Frappe captures the dependencies based on the most recent snapshot of the codebase.In this work we focus on the challenges associated with the management of multiple source code revisions, and investigate strategies to enable advanced code comprehension when the underlying codebase evolves over time. To find the deltas, we detail how entities can be resolved across versions, and propose a model for representing evolving dependency graphs. Our versioned graphs are built using snapshots of large codebases in the order of 13 million lines of code.We show growth and storage benefits of versioned graphs compared to independently storing individual snapshots. We also demonstrate how existing Frappe queries can be executed on versioned graphs and new queries can retrieve a history of changes in a function for a code review use case.",,Electronic:978-1-5386-0992-7; POD:978-1-5386-0993-4,10.1109/ICSME.2017.54,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8094463,entity resolution;evolving dependency graphs;graph database;versioned codebase,Buildings;Data mining;Databases;History;Navigation;Tools,graph theory;query processing;software maintenance;software tools;text analysis,Frappe queries;Oracle Labs;code comprehension tool;code dependencies;code review;comprehension tasks;context-sensitive tools;graph data management;graph database;multiple source code revisions;navigational queries;text-based queries;versioned graphs,,,,,,,,17-22 Sept. 2017,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,9
Behavior Metrics for Prioritizing Investigations of Exceptions,Z. Coker; K. Damevski; C. L. Goues; N. A. Kraft; D. Shepherd; L. Pollock,"Carnegie Mellon Univ., Pittsburgh, PA, USA",2017 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME),20171107,2017,,,554,563,"Many software development teams collect product defect reports, which can either be manually submitted or automatically created from product logs. Periodically, the teams use the collected defect reports to prioritize which defect to address next. We present a set of behavior-based metrics that can be used in this process. These metrics are based on the insight that development teams can estimate user inconvenience from user and application behavior in interaction logs. To estimate user inconvenience, the behavior metrics capture important user and application behavior after exceptions (the defects of interest in our case). We validated these metrics through a survey of how developers would incorporate the behavior metrics into their prioritization decisions. We found that developers change their priority of investigating an exception about 31% of the time after including the behavior metrics in the priority decision. These findings provide evidence that behavior metrics provide a promising advance towards prioritizing application exceptions.",,Electronic:978-1-5386-0992-7; POD:978-1-5386-0993-4,10.1109/ICSME.2017.62,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8094461,Behavior Metrics;Bug Triage;Exceptions;IDE Usage Data;Stack Traces,Atmospheric measurements;Computer bugs;Manuals;Particle measurements;Robots,program debugging;software development management;software metrics,application behavior;behavior metrics;collected defect reports;prioritizing investigations;product defect reports;product logs;software development teams;user inconvenience estimation,,,,,,,,17-22 Sept. 2017,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,9
Towards Accurate Duplicate Bug Retrieval Using Deep Learning Techniques,J. Deshmukh; A. K. M; S. Podder; S. Sengupta; N. Dubash,,2017 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME),20171107,2017,,,115,124,"Duplicate Bug Detection is the problem of identifying whether a newly reported bug is a duplicate of an existing bug in the system and retrieving the original or similar bugs from the past. This is required to avoid costly rediscovery and redundant work. In typical software projects, the number of duplicate bugs reported may run into the order of thousands, making it expensive in terms of cost and time for manual intervention. This makes the problem of duplicate or similar bug detection an important one in Software Engineering domain. However, an automated solution for the same is not quite accurate yet in practice, in spite of many reported approaches using various machine learning techniques. In this work, we propose a retrieval and classification model using Siamese Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) for accurate detection and retrieval of duplicate and similar bugs. We report an accuracy close to 90% and recall rate close to 80%, which makes possible the practical use of such a system. We describe our model in detail along with related discussions from the Deep Learning domain. By presenting the detailed experimental results, we illustrate the effectiveness of the model in practical systems, including for repositories for which supervised training data is not available.",,Electronic:978-1-5386-0992-7; POD:978-1-5386-0993-4,10.1109/ICSME.2017.69,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8094414,Convolutional Neural Networks;Deep Learning;Duplicate Bug Detection;Information Retrieval;Long Short Term Memory;Natural Language Processing;Siamese Networks;Word Embeddings,Computational modeling;Computer bugs;Machine learning;Neural networks;Sun;Training,feedforward neural nets;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;program debugging;software development management,CNN;Deep Learning domain;Deep Learning techniques;Duplicate Bug Detection;LSTM;Long Short Term Memory;Siamese Convolutional Neural Networks;Software Engineering domain;accurate detection;classification model;costly rediscovery;duplicate Bug retrieval;existing bug;machine learning techniques;newly reported bug;original bugs;redundant work;similar bug detection;supervised training data;typical software projects,,,,,,,,17-22 Sept. 2017,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,9
An Experience Report on Applying Passive Learning in a Large-Scale Payment Company,R. Wieman; M. F. Aniche; W. Lobbezoo; S. Verwer; A. v.

The research community has been dedicating great effort in making passive learning techniques more scalable and ready to use by industry. However, there is still a lack of empirical knowledge on the usefulness and applicability of such techniques in large scale real systems. To that aim, we conducted action research over nine months in a large payment company. Throughout this period, we iteratively applied passive learning techniques with the goal of revealing useful information to the development team. In each iteration, we discussed the findings and challenges to the expert developer of the company, and we improved our tools accordingly. In this paper, we present evidence that passive learning can indeed support development teams, a set of lessons we learned during our experience, a proposed guide to facilitate its adoption, and current research challenges.",,Electronic:978-1-5386-0992-7; POD:978-1-5386-0993-4,10.1109/ICSME.2017.71,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8094462,dfasat;experience report;passive learning,Automata;Companies;Industries;Inference algorithms;Merging;Software;Tools,financial data processing;graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence);system monitoring,development team;graph models;large scale real systems;large-scale payment company;passive learning;system behavior;trace logs,,1,,,,,,17-22 Sept. 2017,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,9
Mean Average Distance to Resolver: An Evaluation Metric for Ticket Routing in Expert Network,J. Han; A. Sun,"SAP Innovation Center, Singapore, Singapore",2017 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME),20171107,2017,,,594,602,"In the technical support division of a large enterprise software provider, customers' technical incidents, problems, and change requests are processed as tickets. Each ticket is assigned to a support engineer for processing. Due to the limited expertise of individuals, resolving a ticket may involve routing the ticket among multiple groups of engineers. Each routing step costs time and resources. It is desirable for experts to route a ticket to its most likely resolver with minimum steps. Automated or semi-automated systems are proposed to improve routing efficiency. To evaluate the performance of any system, including human routing, two metrics are commonly used, namely Mean Steps to Resolver (MSTR) and Resolution Rate (RR). The two measures are designed independently, with different objectives and at different scales, making it difficult to compare systems. Moreover, the current measures only consider the resolver group as the ground truth, even during path-level evaluation. They disregard the contribution of intermediate groups during the ticket resolution. In this paper, we propose a distance-based unified evaluation measure named Mean Average Distance to Resolver (MADR). This new framework addresses the aforementioned limitations, and it can be easily modified to adapt to different business requirements in different organizations. In addition, existing evaluation paradigm does not consider human routing steps except the resolver. We argue that the predicted paths may not be followed exactly by expert groups in real operation. An assistive routing evaluation framework is therefore designed to take into account expert's choice when recommendation fails, for each routing. Experiments using proprietary data from a large enterprise demonstrate that MADR can be used to benchmark and compare routing systems.",,Electronic:978-1-5386-0992-7; POD:978-1-5386-0993-4,10.1109/ICSME.2017.18,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8094465,MADR;MSTR;RR;Ticket routing;expert network,Business;Measurement;Routing;Software;Sun;Testing,business data processing;technical support services,Mean Average Distance to Resolver;Mean Steps to Resolver;Resolution Rate;assistive routing evaluation framework;business requirements;distance-based unified evaluation measure;enterprise software provider;expert groups;expert network;human routing steps;path-level evaluation;resolver group;routing efficiency;routing systems;semiautomated systems;support engineer;technical support division;ticket resolution;ticket routing,,,,,,,,17-22 Sept. 2017,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,8
