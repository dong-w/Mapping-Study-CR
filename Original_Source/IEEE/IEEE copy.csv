Vrzakova","Microsoft Research","Proceedings of the Workshop on Eye Movements in Programming","20180614","2018","","","1","5","<p>In order to ensure sufficient quality, software engineers conduct code reviews to read over one another's code looking for errors that should be fixed before committing to their source code repositories. Many kinds of errors are spotted, from simple spelling mistakes and syntax errors, to architectural flaws that may span several files. However, we know little about how software developers read code when looking for defects. What kinds of code trigger engineers to check more deeply into suspected defects? How long do they take to verify whether a defect is really there? We conducted a study of 35 software engineers performing 40 code reviews while capturing their gaze with an eye tracker. We classified each code defect the developers found and captured the patterns of eye gazes used to deliberate about each one. We report how long it took to confirm defect suspicions for each type of defect and the fraction of time spent skimming the code vs. carefully reading it. This work provides a starting point for automating code reviews that could help engineers spend more time focusing on the difficult task of defect confirmation rather than the tedious task of defect discovery.</p>","","","10.1145/3216723.3216727","","","code review;eye tracking","","","","","","","","","","","15-15 June 2018","","ACM","ACM Conferences"

To address these challenges, we introduce CFar, a novel tool design for extending collaborative code review systems with an automated code reviewer whose feedback is based on program-analysis technologies. To validate this design, we implemented CFar as a production-quality tool and conducted a mixed-method empirical evaluation of the tool usage at Microsoft.

In this paper, we serve this purpose by providing a change review assistance tool, namely, MultiViewer, for the most popular OSS GitHub. We define metrics to characterize code changes from multiple perspectives. Specifically, these metrics mine coupling relations among related files in the changes, as well as estimate the change effort, risk and impact.

We thus in this paper present the results of a quantitative study of the effectiveness of code review in a distributed software project involving 201 members. We investigate factors that can potentially influence the outcomes of peer code review.

Popular source control systems aid code review by presenting textual differences between old and new versions of the code, leaving developers with the difficult task of determining whether the differences actually produced the desired behavior. Fortunately, we can mine such information from code repositories. We propose aiding code review with inter-version semantic differential analysis. During review of a new commit, a developer is presented with summaries of both code differences and behavioral differences, which are expressed as diffs of likely invariants extracted by running the system's test cases. As a result, developers can more easily determine that the code changes produced the desired effect. We created an invariant-mining tool chain, Getty, to support our concept of semantically-assisted code review. To validate our approach, 1) we applied Getty to the commits of 6 popular open source projects, 2) we assessed the performance and cost of running Getty in different configurations, and 3) we performed a comparative user study with 18 developers. Our results demonstrate that semantically-assisted code review is feasible, effective, and that real programmers can leverage it to improve the quality of their reviews.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-2684-9; POD:978-1-5386-3976-4","10.1109/ASE.2017.8115666","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8115666","Software behavior;code review;dynamic impact analysis;likely invariants;mining software repository;scalability;software testing","Computer bugs;Navigation;Semantics;Software;Testing;Tools","Internet;data mining;project management;software maintenance","code changes;code differences;code repositories;inter-version semantic differential analysis;invariant-mining tool chain;semantic-assisted code review","","","","","","","","Oct. 30 2017-Nov. 3 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Generally, older coders have more experience. Therefore, the age is considered to positively affect code review. However, in our past study, code understanding speed was relatively slow for older subjects, and memory is needed to understand programs. Similarly, during code review, a subject's age may affect efficiency (e.g., the number of indications per unit time). In the experiment, subjects reviewed source code, referring to mini specification documents. When the code did not follow the document, the subjects indicated the error. We classified subjects into senior and junior groups. In the analysis, we stratified the results based on age, and used correlation coefficients and multiple linear regression to clarify the relationship between age and review performance. We found that age does not affect the efficiency and correctness of code review. Also, the software development experience of subjects is not significantly correlated to performance.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-0941-5; POD:978-1-5386-0942-2","10.1109/ISSRE.2017.37","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8109083","developer's performance;gerontology;software review","Correlation coefficient;Encoding;Gerontology;Java;Measurement;Software","program compilers;program debugging;program diagnostics;software maintenance;software performance evaluation;training","WAP;code review performance;code understanding speed;developer code review performance;older coders;older subjects;software development experience;source code","","","","","","","","23-26 Oct. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unfortunately, tools that support code review treat behavior-preserving changes, or refactorings, and behavior-altering changes, or non-refactorings, the same way, so developers have to spend effort differentiating between the two before they can evaluate the impact of a change set. In this paper, we describe a formative study of 35 developers that motivates the need for separating refactorings from non-refactorings during code review. Then, we present a refactoring-aware code review tool, called ReviewFactor, that differentiates between refactoring and non-refactoring, and allows developers to focus on one of them at a time. Finally, a case study of two open source projects suggests that ReviewFactor detects refactorings in 39% of the commits, and identifies 4.6% of the total lines of code change as refactorings. Our results also show that the precision and recall of ReviewFactor's refactoring detection algorithm are 92.5% and 94.2%, respectively.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-0443-4; POD:978-1-5386-0444-1","10.1109/VLHCC.2017.8103453","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8103453","","Detection algorithms;Java;Manuals;Software;Solids;Tools;Visualization","software maintenance;software quality;software reviews","ReviewFactor;behavior-altering changes;behavior-preserving changes;code change;refactoring detection algorithm;refactoring-aware code review tool;software quality","","","","","","","","11-14 Oct. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Ideally, contributors would use static analysis tools prior to pull request submission so common mistakes could be addressed first, before invoking the reviewer. To explore the potential efficiency gains for peer reviewers, we explore the overlap between reviewer comments on pull requests and warnings from the PMD static analysis tool. In an empirical study of 274 comments from 92 pull requests on GitHub, we observed that PMD overlapped with nearly 16% of the reviewer comments, indicating a time benefit to the reviewer if static analyzers would have been used prior to pull request submission.

Results: We find that code review coverage has a significant effect on software security. We confirm prior results that found a relationship between code review coverage and software defects.

We answer this question with a middle-range theory, which we generated inductively in a mixed methods study, based on interviews, an online survey, and existing findings from related areas.

As the first step towards this goal we focus on the identification of confusion in developers' comments. Based on an existing theoretical framework categorizing expressions of confusion, we manually classify 800 comments from code reviews of the Android project. We observe that confusion can be reasonably well-identified by humans: raters achieve moderate agreement (Fleiss' kappa 0.59 for the general comments and 0.49 for the inline ones). Then, for each kind of comment we build a series of automatic classifiers that, depending on the goals of the further analysis, can be trained to achieve high precision (0.875 for the general comments and 0.615 for the inline ones), high recall (0.944 for the general comments and 0.988 for the inline ones), or substantial precision and recall (0.696 and 0.542 for the general comments and 0.434 and 0.583 for the inline ones, respectively).

This practice causes the similar code fragment (aka code clones) to be scattered throughout a code base. Refactoring for clone removal is beneficial, preventing clones from having negative effects on software quality, such as hidden bug propagation and unintentional inconsistent changes. However, recent research has provided evidence that factoring out clones is not always to reduce the risk of introducing defects, and it is often difficult or impossible to remove clones using standard refactoring techniques. To investigate which or how clones can be refactored, developers typically spend a significant amount of their time managing individual clone instances or clone groups scattered across a large code base. To address the problem, this paper presents a technique for managing clone refactorings, Pattern-based clone Refactoring Inspection (PRI), using refactoring pattern templates. By matching the refactoring pattern templates against a code base, it summarizes refactoring changes of clones, and detects the clone instances not consistently factored out as potential anomalies. PRI also provides novel visualization user interfaces specifically designed for inspecting clone refactorings. In the evaluation, PRI analyzes clone instances in six open source projects. It identifies clone refactorings with 94.1% accuracy and detects inconsistent refactorings with 98.4% accuracy. Our results show that PRI should help developers effectively inspect evolving clones and correctly apply refactorings to clone groups.","0730-3157;07303157","Electronic:978-1-5386-0367-3; POD:978-1-5386-0368-0","10.1109/COMPSAC.2017.242","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8029620","Code clones;maintenance;refactorings;software evolution","Cloning;Computer bugs;Inspection;Pattern matching;Software;Standards;Tools","data visualisation;public domain software;software maintenance;software management;software quality;software tools;source code (software);user interfaces","PRI;clone instances analysis;clone refactorings management;clone removal;code base;code clones;code fragment;code review facilitation;open source projects;pattern-based clone refactoring inspection;refactoring pattern templates matching;software quality;tool support;visualization user interfaces","","","","","","","","4-8 July 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For researchers trying to improve the use of code reviews in industry, it is important to know the reasons for these process variations. We have performed a grounded theory study to clarify process variations and their rationales. The study is based on interviews with software development professionals from 19 companies. These interviews provided insights into the reasons and influencing factors behind the adoption or non-adoption of code reviews as a whole as well as for different process variations. We have condensed these findings into seven hypotheses and a classification of the influencing factors. Our results show the importance of cultural and social issues for review adoption.

To mitigate this problem, we developed Operias, a tool that provides a combined visualization of fine-grained source code differences and coverage impact. Operias works both as a stand-alone tool on specific project versions and as a service hooked to GitHub.

Although prior work uncovers a link between code ownership heuristics and software quality, these heuristics rely solely on the authorship of code changes. In addition to authoring code changes, developers also make important contributions to a module by reviewing code changes. Indeed, recent work shows that reviewers are highly active in modern code review processes, often suggesting alternative solutions or providing updates to the code changes. In this paper, we complement traditional code ownership heuristics using code review activity. Through a case study of six releases of the large Qt and OpenStack systems, we find that: (1) 67%-86% of developers did not author any code changes for a module, but still actively contributed by reviewing 21%-39% of the code changes, (2) code ownership heuristics that are aware of reviewing activity share a relationship with software quality, and (3) the proportion of reviewers without expertise shares a strong, increasing relationship with the likelihood of having post-release defects. Our results suggest that reviewing activity captures an important aspect of code ownership, and should be included in approximations of it in future studies.","","Electronic:978-1-4503-3900-1; POD:978-1-5090-2071-3","10.1145/2884781.2884852","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7886978","Expertise;Ownership;Software Quality","Birds;Conferences;Organizations;Software design;Software quality;Software systems","software quality;source code (software)","OpenStack systems;code change authorship;code ownership heuristics;code review activity;large Qt systems;large software systems;modern code review processes;post-release defects;software quality","","4","","","","","","14-22 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recent work shows that lax reviewing can impact the quality of open source systems. In this paper, we investigate the impact that code reviewing practices have on the quality of a proprietary system that is developed by Sony Mobile. We begin by replicating open source analyses of the relationship between software quality (as approximated by post-release defect-proneness) and: (1) code review coverage, i.e., the proportion of code changes that have been reviewed and (2) code review participation, i.e., the degree of reviewer involvement in the code review process. We also perform a qualitative analysis, with a survey of 93 stakeholders, semi-structured interviews with 15 stakeholders, and a follow-up survey of 25 senior engineers.

Teaching students how to achieve quality and how to conduct code reviews in projects is often neglected, although it helps to improve maintainability. In this paper we describe an informal review technique: branch based code reviews. Developers realize requirements in feature branches. Before they integrate source code into the main codebase, the code is reviewed asynchronously over the Internet in a quality gate to identify defects, design flaws and code flaws. Traditionally reviewing has been a task of the instructor. In our course, we delegate it to students of the development team. Our hypothesis is that students learn and adapt best practices from each other, improving code quality and their coding skills. We applied this technique in a workflow during a project- based capstone course over the period of three semesters. 300 students conducted 2939 code reviews with 4665 comments in 33 projects with industry customers. We evaluated the workflow in a qualitative study using interviews. Our key findings are that students do not longer see reviews as a bureaucratic burden and improve their skills through the comments of experienced team members. They are convinced that reviewing code leads to higher code quality and 89 % want to use the workflow again in future projects.","","Electronic:978-1-4503-4205-6; POD:978-1-5090-2245-8","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7883324","Branching Model;Capstone Course;Code Quality;Distributed Version Control;Merge Request;Pair Programming;Peer Learning;Pull Request","Education;Industries;Inspection;Programming;Software;Software engineering;Taxonomy","computer science education;software quality;source code (software)","branch based code reviews;branch based workflows;code review management;high code quality;informal review technique;software development;software engineering capstone courses;university environment","","","","","","","","14-22 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The uptake of such practices is dependent on several factors, specifically the availability of tools that aid in providing an easy-to-use and intuitive platform to perform code reviews, and is readily accessible to members of a project. This paper briefly explores the act of code review, identifies the pitfalls of existing code review tools, and proposes the design and development of a web-based code review application, along with the evaluation of the prototype.

It is widely recognized that peer review is an efficient and effective practice for improving software quality and reducing defect proneness. For successful review process, peer reviewers should have a deep experience and knowledge with the code being reviewed, and familiar to work and collaborate together. However, one of the main challenging tasks in modern code review is to find the most appropriate reviewers for submitted code changes. So far, reviewers assignment is still a manual, costly and time-consuming task. In this paper, we introduce a search-based approach, namely RevRec, to provide decision-making support for code change submitters and/or reviewers assigners to identify most appropriate peer reviewers for their code changes. RevRec aims at finding reviewers to be assigned for a code change based on their expertise and collaboration in past reviews using genetic algorithm (GA). We evaluated our approach on a benchmark of three open-source software systems, Android, OpenStack, and Qt. Results indicate that RevRec accurately recommends code reviewers with up to 59% of precision and 74% of recall. Our experiments provide evidence that leveraging reviewers expertise from their prior reviews and the socio-technical aspects of the team work and collaboration is relevant in improving the performance of peer reviewers recommendation in modern code review.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-3806-0; POD:978-1-5090-3807-7","10.1109/ICSME.2016.65","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7816482","Code review;Reviewer recommendation;Search-based Software Engineeging","Genetic algorithms;Search problems;Sociology;Software;Software engineering;Teamwork","Android (operating system);decision making;genetic algorithms;public domain software;search problems;software quality;software reviews;source code (software);team working","Android;OpenStack;Qt;RevRec;code review;decision making support;genetic algorithm;open-source software systems;peer review;precision;recall;search-based approach;search-based peer reviewer recommendation;software development;software quality;team work socio-technical aspects","","","","","","","","2-7 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, from our empirical study, we found that some patches are reviewed by only one reviewer, and some reviewers did not continue the review discussion, which can have negative effects on software quality. To understand these reviewers' behaviors, we model the code review situation based on the snowdrift game, which is used to analyze social dilemmas. With this game-theoretical modeling, we found that it can explain reviewers' behaviors well.","","Electronic:978-1-4503-4155-4; POD:978-1-5090-2198-7","10.1109/CHASE.2016.022","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7809488","Code review;Empirical Study;Game Theory","Analytical models;Conferences;Games;Servers","game theory;software quality;source code (software)","Gerrit dataset;code review participation;code review situation model;game theoretical modeling;knowledge transfer;snowdrift game;social dilemma;source code change quality","","","","","","","","16-16 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"A Security Perspective on Code Review: The Case of Chromium","M. di Biase; M. Bruntink; A.

Although evidence showed that higher levels of review coverage relates to less post-release bugs, it remains unknown the effectiveness of MCR at specifically finding security issues. We present a work we conduct aiming to fill that gap by exploring the MCR process in the Chromium open source project. We manually analyzed large sets of registered (114 cases) and missed (71 cases) security issues by backtracking in the project's issue, review, and code histories. This enabled us to qualify MCR in Chromium from the security perspective from several angles: Are security issues being discussed frequently? What categories of security issues are often missed or found? What characteristics of code reviews appear relevant to the discovery rate? Within the cases we analyzed, MCR in Chromium addresses security issues at a rate of 1% of reviewers' comments. Chromium code reviews mostly tend to miss language-specific issues (eg C++ issues and buffer overflows) and domain-specific ones (eg such as Cross-Site Scripting), when code reviews address issues, mostly they address those that pertain to the latter type. Initial evidence points to reviews conducted by more than 2 reviewers being more successful at finding security issues.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-3848-0; POD:978-1-5090-3849-7","10.1109/SCAM.2016.30","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7781793","code review;empirical software engineering;mining software repositories;modern code review;security flaw;software security","Chromium;Computer bugs;Inspection;Manuals;Security;Software quality","backtracking;program debugging;public domain software;safety-critical software;software quality;source code (software)","Chromium code reviews;Chromium open source project;MCR;backtracking;bugs;domain-specific ones;language-specific issues;modern code review;security issues;software development process;software quality improvement","","","","","","","","2-3 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recently, Modern Code Review (MCR) has been widely adopted in both open source and proprietary projects. To evaluate the impact that characteristics of MCR practices have on software quality, this paper comparatively studies MCR practices in defective and clean source code files. We investigate defective files along two perspectives: 1) files that will eventually have defects (i.e., future-defective files) and 2) files that have historically been defective (i.e., risky files). Through an empirical study of 11,736 reviews of changes to 24,486 files from the Qt open source project, we find that both future-defective files and risky files tend to be reviewed less rigorously than their clean counterparts. We also find that the concerns addressed during the code reviews of both defective and clean files tend to enhance evolvability, i.e., ease future maintenance (like documentation), rather than focus on functional issues (like incorrect program logic). Our findings suggest that although functionality concerns are rarely addressed during code review, the rigor of the reviewing process that is applied to a source code file throughout a development cycle shares a link with its defect proneness.</p>","","","","","","code review;software quality","","","","","","","","","","","16-24 May 2015","","ACM","ACM Conferences"

As part of this approach, developers are often presented with a list of open code reviews requiring attention; it is left to the developer to find a suitable review on which to work on from a long list of reviews. We present an investigation of two algorithms that recommend an ordering of the list of open reviews based on properties of the reviews. We use a simulation study over the JGit project from the Eclipse Foundation to show that an algorithm based on ordering reviews from least lines of codes changed in the code review to most lines of code out performs other algorithms. This algorithm shows promise for eliminating stagnation of reviews and optimizing the average duration reviews are open. </p>","","","10.1145/2984043.2989224","","","code inspection;software development process","","","","","","","","","","","Oct. 30 2016-Nov. 4 2016","","ACM","ACM Conferences"

Vulnerabilities are a particularly nasty set of bugs that can be rare, difficult to reproduce, and require specialized skills to recognize. Does Linus' Law apply to vulnerabilities empirically? In this study, we analyzed 159,254 code reviews, 185,948 Git commits, and 667 post-release vulnerabilities in the Chromium browser project. We formulated, collected, and analyzed various metrics related to Linus' Law to explore the connection between collaborative reviews and vulnerabilities that were missed by the review process. Our statistical association results showed that source code files reviewed by more developers are, counter-intuitively, more likely to be vulnerable (even after accounting for file size). However, files are less likely to be vulnerable if they were reviewed by developers who had experience participating on prior vulnerability-fixing reviews. The results indicate that lack of security experience and lack of collaborator familiarity are key risk factors in considering Linus’ Law with vulnerabilities. </p>","","","10.1145/2661685.2661687","","","code review;socio-technical;vulnerability","","","","","6","","","","","","17-17 Nov. 2014","","ACM","ACM Conferences"

Developers consider code review important, stating that in addition to finding defects, code reviews offer other benefits, including knowledge sharing, community building, and maintaining code quality. The quality of the code submitted for review helps reviewers form impressions about their teammates, which can influence future collaborations. We found a large amount of similarity between the Microsoft and OSS respondents.

Prior work has shown that the formal code inspections of the past tend to improve the quality of software delivered by students and small teams. However, the formal code inspection process mandates strict review criteria (e.g., in-person meetings and reviewer checklists) to ensure a base level of review quality, while the modern, lightweight code reviewing process does not. Although recent work explores the modern code review process qualitatively, little research quantitatively explores the relationship between properties of the modern code review process and software quality. Hence, in this paper, we study the relationship between software quality and: (1) code review coverage, i.e., the proportion of changes that have been code reviewed, and (2) code review participation, i.e., the degree of reviewer involvement in the code review process. Through a case study of the Qt, VTK, and ITK projects, we find that both code review coverage and participation share a significant link with software quality. Low code review coverage and participation are estimated to produce components with up to two and five additional post-release defects respectively.

Balachandran","VMware, India","Proceedings of the 2013 International Conference on Software Engineering","20160129","2013","","","931","940","<p> Peer code review is a cost-effective software defect detection technique. Tool assisted code review is a form of peer code review, which can improve both quality and quantity of reviews. However, there is a significant amount of human effort involved even in tool based code reviews. Using static analysis tools, it is possible to reduce the human effort by automating the checks for coding standard violations and common defect patterns. Towards this goal, we propose a tool called Review Bot for the integration of automatic static analysis with the code review process. Review Bot uses output of multiple static analysis tools to publish reviews automatically. Through a user study, we show that integrating static analysis tools with code review process can improve the quality of code review. The developer feedback for a subset of comments from automatic reviews shows that the developers agree to fix 93% of all the automatically generated comments. There is only 14.71% of all the accepted comments which need improvements in terms of priority, comment message, etc. Another problem with tool assisted code review is the assignment of appropriate reviewers. Review Bot solves this problem by generating reviewer recommendations based on change history of source code lines. Our experimental results show that the recommendation accuracy is in the range of 60%-92%, which is significantly better than a comparable method based on file change history. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","24","","","","","","18-26 May 2013","","ACM","ACM Conferences"

Some of our study findings are similar to the findings of previous studies on code reviews. In the projects under our study, we found that, most of the revisions are not submitted for peer review.

Modern Code Review (MCR), a lightweight variant of the code inspections investigated since the 1970s, prevails today both in industry and open-source software (OSS) systems. The objective of this paper is to increase our understanding of the practical benefits that the MCR process produces on reviewed source code. To that end, we empirically explore the problems fixed through MCR in OSS systems. We manually classified over 1,400 changes taking place in reviewed code from two OSS projects into a validated categorization scheme. Surprisingly, results show that the types of changes due to the MCR process in OSS are strikingly similar to those in the industry and academic systems from literature, featuring the similar 75:25 ratio of maintainability-related to functional problems. We also reveal that 7–35% of review comments are discarded and that 10–22% of the changes are not triggered by an explicit review comment. Patterns emerged in the review data; we investigated them revealing the technical factors that influence the number of changes due to the MCR process. We found that bug-fixing tasks lead to fewer changes and tasks with more altered files and a higher code churn have more changes. Contrary to intuition, the person of the reviewer had no impact on the number of changes. </p>","","","10.1145/2597073.2597082","","","Code Review;Defects;Open Source Software","","","","","24","","","","","","May 31 2014-June 1 2014","","ACM","ACM Conferences"

We observed, interviewed, and surveyed developers and managers and manually classified hundreds of review comments across diverse teams at Microsoft. Our study reveals that while finding defects remains the main motivation for review, reviews are less about defects than expected and instead provide additional benefits such as knowledge transfer, increased team awareness, and creation of alternative solutions to problems. Moreover, we find that code and change understanding is the key aspect of code reviewing and that developers employ a wide range of mechanisms to meet their understanding needs, most of which are not met by current tools. We provide recommendations for practitioners and researchers. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","88","","","","","","18-26 May 2013","","ACM","ACM Conferences"

Inspired by the <i>code inspection</i> process used in the software industry, a PCR is a collaborative activity in which a small team of students, led by a trained moderator: (a) walk through segments of each other's programming solutions, (b) check the code against a list of best coding practices, and (c) discuss and log issues that arise. To evaluate the viability and effectiveness of this approach, we conducted a series of four mixed-method empirical studies of various implementations of PCRs in CS1 courses at Washington State University. The first study validated the viability of the PCR activity. Using a quasi-experimental design, the final three studies evaluated two alternative implementations of PCRs—<i>face-to-face</i> and <i>online</i>. Our results provide evidence that PCRs can promote positive attitudinal shifts, and hone skills in critical review, teamwork, and communication.

Since millions of credit card records are stolen every year, the cost can easily run into billions of dollars. Consequently, application security is a very important concern during the development of applications today. Resolving security problems later in the development process is very time consuming and expensive. Therefore, it is favorable to detect and resolve security vulnerabilities as soon as possible during the development process. By using a technique called static analysis, it is possible to partially overcome this problem. Static analysis tools examine source code statically (when not running), and attempt to detect security vulnerabilities. Unfortunately, however, static analysis tools generate very large amounts of false positives. In order for static analysis tools to be effective, extraordinarily complex custom rules must be written for the tool. This must be done by a security expert for every application the tool runs on. To make matters worse, communicating information about complex vulnerabilities to application developers presents a unique challenge in and of itself. If the developer does not understand why a certain line is flagged as potentially vulnerable and is not provided with detailed information, it will be far more difficult for him or her to resolve the problem. Consequently, static analysis tools are seldom used.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-7457-6; POD:978-1-4673-7458-3","10.1109/VLHCC.2015.7357234","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7357234","","","feature extraction;program diagnostics;security of data;software reviews;source code (software)","interactive annotation;security vulnerability detection;source code review;static analysis","","","","10","","","","18-22 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We explore the relationships between the reviewers' code inspections and a set of factors, both personal and social in nature, that might affect the quality of such inspections. We applied the SZZ algorithm to detect bug-inducing changes that were then linked to the code review information extracted from the issue tracking system. We found that 54% of the reviewed changes introduced bugs in the code.

Recently, many open source projects have begun practicing code review through “modern” tools such as GitHub pull-requests and Gerrit. Many commercial software companies use similar tools for code review internally. These tools enable the owner of a source code change to request individuals to participate in the review, i.e., reviewers. However, this task comes with a challenge. Prior work has shown that the benefits of code review are dependent upon the expertise of the reviewers involved. Thus, a common problem faced by authors of source code changes is that of identifying the best reviewers for their source code change. To address this problem, we present an approach, namely cHRev, to automatically recommend reviewers who are best suited to participate in a given review, based on their historical contributions as demonstrated in their prior reviews. We evaluate the effectiveness of cHRev on three open source systems as well as a commercial codebase at Microsoft and compare it to the state of the art in reviewer recommendation. We show that by leveraging the specific information in previously completed reviews (i.e.,quantification of review comments and their recency), we are able to improve dramatically on the performance of prior approaches, which (limitedly) operate on generic review information (i.e., reviewers of similar source code file and path names) or source coderepository data.

By matching a generalized template against the codebase, it summarizes similar changes and detects potential mistakes. We evaluated Critics using two methods. First, we conducted a user study at Salesforce.com, where professional engineers used Critics to investigate diff patches authored by their own team. After using Critics, all six participants indicated that they would like Critics to be integrated into their current code review environment.

In a three-stage mixed research study, we qualitatively investigated what aspects of code reviews make them useful to developers, used our findings to build and verify a classification model that can distinguish between useful and not useful code review feedback, and finally we used this classifier to classify review comments enabling us to empirically investigate factors that lead to more effective code review feedback. In total, we analyzed 1.5 millions review comments from five Microsoft projects and uncovered many factors that affect the usefulness of review feedback. For example, we found that the proportion of useful comments made by a reviewer increases dramatically in the first year that he or she is at Microsoft but tends to plateau afterwards.

We investigate defective files along two perspectives: 1) files that will eventually have defects (i.e., Future-defective files) and 2) files that have historically been defective (i.e., Risky files). Through an empirical study of 11,736 reviews of changes to 24,486 files from the Qt open source project, we find that both future-defective files and risky files tend to be reviewed less rigorously than their clean counterparts.

Effectively performing code review can improve the overall software quality. In recent years, Modern Code Review (MCR), a lightweight and tool-based code inspection, has been widely adopted in both proprietary and open-source software systems. Finding appropriate code-reviewers in MCR is a necessary step of reviewing a code change. However, little research is known the difficulty of finding code-reviewers in a distributed software development and its impact on reviewing time. In this paper, we investigate the impact of reviews with code-reviewer assignment problem has on reviewing time. We find that reviews with code-reviewer assignment problem take 12 days longer to approve a code change. To help developers find appropriate code-reviewers, we propose RevFinder, a file location-based code-reviewer recommendation approach. We leverage a similarity of previously reviewed file path to recommend an appropriate code-reviewer. The intuition is that files that are located in similar file paths would be managed and reviewed by similar experienced code-reviewers. Through an empirical evaluation on a case study of 42,045 reviews of Android Open Source Project (AOSP), OpenStack, Qt and LibreOffice projects, we find that RevFinder accurately recommended 79% of reviews with a top 10 recommendation. RevFinder also correctly recommended the code-reviewers with a median rank of 4. The overall ranking of RevFinder is 3 times better than that of a baseline approach. We believe that RevFinder could be applied to MCR in order to help developers find appropriate code-reviewers and speed up the overall code review process.","1534-5351;15345351","Electronic:978-1-4799-8469-5; POD:978-1-4799-8470-1","10.1109/SANER.2015.7081824","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7081824","Code-Reviewer Recommendation;Distributed Software Development;Modern Code Review","Androids;History;Humanoid robots;Manuals;Open source software;Software systems","public domain software;software reviews","AOSP;Android open source project;LibreOffice project;MCR;OpenStack;Qt project;RevFinder;code-reviewer recommendation approach;file location;modern code review;open-source software system;proprietary software system;software code review","","6","","41","","","","2-6 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper investigates whether warnings highlighted by static analysis tools are taken care of during code reviews and, whether there are kinds of warnings that tend to be removed more than others. Results of a study conducted by mining the Gerrit repository of six Java open source projects indicate that the density of warnings only slightly vary after each review. The overall percentage of warnings removed during reviews is slightly higher than what previous studies found for the overall project evolution history. However, when looking (quantitatively and qualitatively) at specific categories of warnings, we found that during code reviews developers focus on certain kinds of problems. For such categories of warnings the removal percentage tend to be very high, often above 50% and sometimes up to 100%. Examples of those are warnings in the imports, regular expressions, and type resolution categories. In conclusion, while a broad warning detection might produce way too many false positives, enforcing the removal of certain warnings prior to the patch submission could reduce the amount of effort provided during the code review process.","1534-5351;15345351","Electronic:978-1-4799-8469-5; POD:978-1-4799-8470-1","10.1109/SANER.2015.7081826","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7081826","Code Review;Empirical Study;Mining Software Repositories;Static Analysis","Context;Data mining;Encoding;History;Java;Software;Standards","Java;project management;software management;software quality;software tools","Gerrit repository;Java open source projects;broad warning detection;code quality;code review process;code reviews developers;coding standards;patch submission;project evolution history;software projects;static analysis tools","","10","","30","","","","2-6 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, such an exhaustive review would be difficult because the available time and effort are in reality limited. Thus, practitioners prioritize the source files in terms of bug-proneness by using related data such as bug fix history, and review them in decreasing order of priority-such strategy in this paper is called the ""conventional method."" While the conventional method is straightforward, it focuses only on the bug-proneness and cannot consider the review cost properly, so the method does not produce a cost-effective review plan. To take into account both the bug-proneness and the review cost, this paper proposes a 0-1 programming model-based method for planning code review. The proposed method formulates a review plan as a 0-1 programming problem, and the solution is the recommendation list of source files to be reviewed. Moreover, the proposed method considers the type of file-if the file is newly-developed or not. Such difference in file type may affect on how to evaluate the bug-proneness and the review strategy: newly-developed files are notable but not appeared in the bug fix history. This paper conducts a case study using popular open source software, shows that the proposed method is up to 42% more effective than the conventional method in recommending buggy files as the review targets.","1530-1362;15301362","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-2143-0; Electronic:978-1-4799-2144-7; POD:978-1-4799-2145-4","10.1109/APSEC.2013.109","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6754348","0-1 programming model;bug fix history;code review;cost-effectiveness","Complexity theory;History;Mathematical model;Measurement;Planning;Programming;Software","integer programming;linear programming;program debugging;software cost estimation;software quality;source code (software)","0-1 programming model-based method;bug fix history;bug-proneness;cost-effective review plan;file type;open source software;planning code review;review cost;software quality improvement;source files","","0","","15","","","","2-5 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In addition to increasing software quality, there is anecdotal evidence that peer code review has other benefits, including: sharing knowledge, sharing expertise, sharing development techniques, and most importantly building accurate peer impressions between the code review participants. To further investigate the presence of these benefits, we surveyed members of popular OSS communities who were involved with peer code review. We used established scales from Psychology, Information science, and Organizational Behavior to create survey questions. We also enforced multiple reliability and validity measures to ensure higher confidence in the survey results. In this paper, we present a subset of the surveys results focused on better understanding four aspects of peer impression formation: trust, reliability, perception of expertise, and friendship. The results indicate that there is indeed a high level of trust, reliability, perception of expertise, and friendship between OSS peers who have participated in code review for a period of time.

In this paper, we describe an empirical study of the code review process for WebKit, a large, open source project; we replicate the impact of previously studied factors - such as patch size, priority, and component and extend these studies by investigating organizational (the company) and personal dimensions (reviewer load and activity, patch writer experience) on code review response time and outcome.

This often leads to unmaintainable code and potential bugs in later stages of software life cycle. It is important to detect and correct these issues early in the development cycle, when it is less expensive to fix. Even though static analysis techniques such as tool-assisted code review are effective in addressing this problem, there is significant amount of human effort involved in identifying the source code issues and fixing it. Review Bot is a tool designed to reduce the human effort and improve the quality in code reviews by generating automatic reviews using static analysis output. In this paper, we propose an extension to Review Bot- addition of a component called Fix-it for the auto-correction of various source code issues using Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) transformations. Fix-it uses built-in fixes to automatically fix various issues reported by the auto-reviewer component in Review Bot, thereby reducing the human effort to greater extent. Fix-it is designed to be highly extensible-users can add support for the detection of new defect patterns using XPath or XQuery and provide fixes for it based on AST transformations written in a high-level programming language. It allows the user to treat the AST as a DOM tree and run XQuery UPDATE expressions to perform AST transformations as part of a fix. Fix-it also includes a designer application which enables Review Bot administrators to design new defect patterns and fixes. The developer feedback on a stand-alone prototype indicates the possibility of significant human effort reduction in code reviews using Fix-it.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-5739-5; POD:978-1-4673-5738-8","10.1109/SCAM.2013.6648198","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6648198","","Abstracts;Conferences;Encoding;Java;Standards;XML","high level languages;human factors;program debugging;program diagnostics;software quality;software reviews;software tools;source coding;tree data structures","AST transformations;DOM tree;Fix-it;Review Bot administrators;XPath;XQuery UPDATE expressions;abstract syntax tree transformations;auto-reviewer component;automatic review generation;checked-in source code;code review quality;coding standard violations;defect patterns;extensible code auto-fix component;high-level programming language;human effort;software life cycle;source code issues;static analysis output;static analysis techniques;tool-assisted code review;unmaintainable code","","4","","19","","","","22-23 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A major problem is to read and understand source-code that was produced by someone else. With different programming styles and complex interactions, understanding the code under review is the most expensive sub-task of a code review. As with many other modern software engineering practices, code reviews may be applied as a continuous process to reduce the effort and support the concept of collective ownership. This study evaluates the effect of a continuous code review process on the understandability and collective ownership of the code base. A group of 8 subjects performed a total of 114 code reviews within 18 months in an industrial context and conducted an expert evaluation according to this research question. This study concludes that there is a clear positive effect on the understandability and collective ownership of the code base with continuous code reviews, but also limiting factors and drawbacks for complex review tasks.","1092-8138;10928138","Electronic:978-1-4673-3092-3; POD:978-1-4673-3090-9","10.1109/ICPC.2013.6613847","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6613847","Code review;IEEE-1028;aviation;code quality;continuous;inspection;safety","Airports;Coherence;Context;Planning;Quality assurance;Software;Timing","programming;quality assurance;reverse engineering;software quality","collective ownership;complex interactions;continuous code reviews;program understanding;programming styles;quality assurance technique;software engineering practices;source-code understanding","","3","","14","","","","20-21 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Reducing human effort and improving quality in peer code reviews using automatic static analysis and reviewer recommendation","V. Balachandran","VMware, Bangalore, India","2013 35th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE)","20130926","2013","","","931","940","Peer code review is a cost-effective software defect detection technique. Tool assisted code review is a form of peer code review, which can improve both quality and quantity of reviews. However, there is a significant amount of human effort involved even in tool based code reviews. Using static analysis tools, it is possible to reduce the human effort by automating the checks for coding standard violations and common defect patterns. Towards this goal, we propose a tool called Review Bot for the integration of automatic static analysis with the code review process. Review Bot uses output of multiple static analysis tools to publish reviews automatically. Through a user study, we show that integrating static analysis tools with code review process can improve the quality of code review. The developer feedback for a subset of comments from automatic reviews shows that the developers agree to fix 93% of all the automatically generated comments. There is only 14.71% of all the accepted comments which need improvements in terms of priority, comment message, etc. Another problem with tool assisted code review is the assignment of appropriate reviewers. Review Bot solves this problem by generating reviewer recommendations based on change history of source code lines. Our experimental results show that the recommendation accuracy is in the range of 60%-92%, which is significantly better than a comparable method based on file change history.","0270-5257;02705257","Electronic:978-1-4673-3076-3; POD:978-1-4673-3075-6","10.1109/ICSE.2013.6606642","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6606642","","Algorithm design and analysis;Encoding;History;Inspection;Java;Software;Standards","program diagnostics;program testing;software engineering","Review Bot tool;automatic static analysis;coding standard violation checking automation;comment message;cost-effective software defect detection technique;defect pattern;developer feedback;file change history;peer code review;quality improvement;reviewer recommendation;source code line change history;static analysis tools;tool assisted code review","","24","1","24","","","","18-26 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We observed, interviewed, and surveyed developers and managers and manually classified hundreds of review comments across diverse teams at Microsoft. Our study reveals that while finding defects remains the main motivation for review, reviews are less about defects than expected and instead provide additional benefits such as knowledge transfer, increased team awareness, and creation of alternative solutions to problems. Moreover, we find that code and change understanding is the key aspect of code reviewing and that developers employ a wide range of mechanisms to meet their understanding needs, most of which are not met by current tools.

We have found that PCRs not only improve the quality of students' code, but also positively impact students' communication and sense of community. However, implementing PCRs also presents a key logistical challenge: how to make code solutions and review results accessible to team members before, during, and after the team reviews? To address this challenge, we are developing an online environment specifically tailored to support PCRs. Our environment enables students to submit their code solutions; to review team members' code solutions on-line prior to PCRs; to carry out PCRs; and to resubmit their solutions based upon the results of the PCRs.

With the high renewable power penetration levels, one of the key power system parameters, namely reactive power is affected, provoking steady-state voltage and dynamic/ transient stability issues. Therefore, it is imperative to maintain and manage adequate reactive power reserve to ensure a stable and reliable power grid. This paper presents a comprehensive literature review on reactive power management in renewable rich power grids. Reactive power requirements stipulated in different grid-codes for REGs are summarized to assess their adequacy for future network requirements. The PEC interfaced REGs are discussed with special emphasis on their reactive power compensation capability and control schemes. Along with REGs, conventional reactive power support devices (e.g. capacitor banks) and PEC interfaced reactive power support devices (e.g. static synchronous compensators (STATCOMs)) play an indispensable role in reactive power management of renewable rich power grids, and thus their reactive power control capabilities and limitations are thoroughly reviewed in this paper. Then, various reactive power control strategies are reviewed with a special emphasis on their advantages/ disadvantages. Reactive power coordination between support devices and their optimal capacity are vital for an efficient and stable management of the power grid. Accordingly, the prominent reactive power coordination and optimization algorithms are critically examined and discussed in the paper. Finally, key issues pertinent to the reactive power management in renewable rich power grids are enlisted with some important technical recommendations for the power industry, policymakers and academic researchers.","","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2838563","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8361423","Control strategies;grid codes;optimization algorithms;reactive power;renewable energy generators (REGs);solar photovoltaic (PV);wind generation","Generators;Power grids;Power system stability;Reactive power;Renewable energy sources;Voltage control;Wind power generation","","","","","","","","","20180521","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The source code analysis of these applications requires the extraction and examination of artifacts, which are build using multiple programming languages along with their dependencies. A large number of studies presented on multilingual source code analysis and its applications in the last one and half decade. The objective of this systematic literature review (SLR) is to summarize state of the art and prominent areas for future research. This SLR is based on different techniques, tools, and methodologies to analyze multilingual source code applications. We finalized 56 multi-discipline published papers relevant to multilingual source code analysis and its applications out of 3820 papers, filtered through multi-stage search criterion. Based on our findings, we highlight research gaps and challenges in the field of multilingual applications. The research findings are presented in the form of research problems, research contributions, challenges, and future prospects. We identified 46 research issues and requirements for analyzing multilingual applications and grouped them in 13 different software engineering domains. We examined the research contributions and mapped them with individual research problems. We presented the research contributions in the form of tools techniques and approaches that are presented in the form of research models, platforms, frameworks, prototype models, and case studies. Every research has its limitations or prospects for future research. We highlighted the limitations and future perspectives and grouped them in various software engineering domains.

However, successful apps can receive up to several thousands of reviews per day, manually analysing each of them is a time consuming task. To help developers deal with the large amount of available data, we manually analyzed the text of 1566 user reviews and defined a high and low level taxonomy containing mobile specific categories (e.g. performance, resources, battery, memory, etc.) highly relevant for developers during the planning of maintenance and evolution activities. Then we built the User Request Referencer (URR) prototype, using Machine Learning and Information Retrieval techniques, to automatically classify reviews according to our taxonomy and recommend for a particular review what are the source code files that need to be modified to handle the issue described in the user review. We evaluated our approach through an empirical study involving the reviews and code of 39 mobile applications.

The included PSs were selected using inclusion and exclusion criteria applied to relevant articles published before the end of 2015. We analyzed the PSs based on a set of classification criteria, including software quality attributes and measures, refactoring scenarios, evaluation approaches, datasets, and impact results. We followed the vote-counting approach to determine the level of consistency among the PS reported results concerning the relationship between refactoring and software quality. The results indicated that different refactoring scenarios sometimes have opposite impacts on different quality attributes. Therefore, it is false that refactoring always improves all software quality aspects. The vote-counting study provided a clear view of the impacts of some individual refactoring scenarios on some internal quality attributes such as cohesion, coupling, complexity, inheritance, and size, but failed to identify their impacts on external and other internal quality attributes due to insufficient findings.","0098-5589;00985589","","10.1109/TSE.2017.2658573","; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7833023","quality attribute;quality measure;refactoring scenario;systematic literature review","Bibliographies;Libraries;Object oriented modeling;Software quality;Systematics;Unified modeling language","software maintenance;software metrics;software quality","76 relevant primary studies;PSs;classification criteria;code restructuring;different quality attributes;different refactoring scenarios;evaluation approaches;external quality;individual refactoring scenarios;internal quality;maintenance task;opposite impacts;software quality aspects;software quality attributes;software refactoring;systematic literature review;vote-counting approach;vote-counting study","","","","","","","20170125","Jan. 1 2018","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Evolution history recorded in software repositories, e.g., Version Control Systems, reflects people's software development practice. Exploring this history could help practitioners to reuse the best practices therefore improve productivity and software quality. Because of the difficulty of collecting and standardizing data, most existing work could only utilize small project set. In this study, we target the open source software universe to build a universal code evolution model for large-scale data. We consider code evolution from two aspects: code version changing history in a single project and code reuse history in the whole universe. In the model, files/modules are built as nodes, and relations (version change or reuse) between files/modules are built as connections. Based on the model, we design and implement a code evolution review framework, i.e., Code Evolution Reviewer (CER), which provides a series of data interfaces to review code evolution history, in particular, code version changing in single project and code reuse among projects. Further, CER could be utilized to explore best practices across large-scale project set.</p>","","","10.1145/2430475.2430488","","","OSS universe;best practice;code evolution;code reuse","","","","","","","","","","","30-31 Oct. 2012","","ACM","ACM Conferences"

There are several primary studies on traceability between software architecture and source code but so far no systematic literature review (SLR) has been undertaken. This study presents an SLR which has been carried out to discover the existing traceability approaches and tools between software architecture and source code, as well as the empirical evidence for these approaches, their benefits and liabilities, their relations to software architecture understanding, and issues, barriers, and challenges of the approaches. In our SLR the ACM Guide to Computing Literature has been electronically searched to accumulate the biggest share of relevant scientific bibliographic citations from the major publishers in computing. The search strategy identified 742 citations, out of which 11 have been included in our study, dated from 1999 to July, 2013, after applying our inclusion and exclusion criteria. Our SLR resulted in the identification of the current state-of-the-art of traceability approaches and tools between software architecture and source code, as well as gaps and pointers for further research. Moreover, the classification scheme developed in this paper can serve as a guide for researchers and practitioners to find a specific approach or set of approaches that is of interest to them.</p>","","","10.1145/2601248.2601278","","","software architecture;source code;systematic literature review;traceability","","","","","1","","","","","","13-14 May 2014","","ACM","ACM Conferences"

Clustering, breaking a system into multiple clusters, is commonly used technique to scale these tools to large systems. Due to the imprecise nature of static analysis and the conservative approach taken for the inter-cluster communication (data sharing), a large number of analysis warnings are generated. All these reported warnings need to be reviewed manually to check if they represent a defect, and it is a time consuming process. We observe many of the reported warnings are common to multiple clusters and reviewing each of them individually incurs redundancy. We present an approach to improve the manual review process by eliminating the redundancy. This is achieved by grouping the inter-cluster common warnings such that review of a grouped warning under given constraint guarantees same review judgment for the other cluster warnings in the same group. Empirical results obtained with the presented approach indicate that -- a) on an average, 45% of total warnings are common to multiple clusters, and b) with the proposed grouping technique, the manual efforts required to review these common warnings are reduced by 60%.","1063-6773;10636773","Electronic:978-1-4799-6146-7; POD:978-1-4799-6147-4","10.1109/ICSME.2014.97","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6976141","Clustering;False Positives;Manual Review of Warnings;Static Analysis","Arrays;Context;Indexes;Manuals;Redundancy;Software;Software engineering","pattern clustering;program diagnostics;program verification","clustered-code analysis warnings;early defect detection;grouping technique;intercluster common warnings;intercluster communication;manual review process;review judgment;software verification;static analysis tools","","3","","12","","","","Sept. 29 2014-Oct. 3 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Magnetotelluric 3-D inversion—a review of two successful workshops on forward and inversion code testing and comparison","M. P. Miensopust; P. Queralt; A. G. Jones","","Geophysical Journal International","20180118","2013","193","3","1216","1238","Over the last half decade the need for, and importance of, three-dimensional (3-D) modelling of magnetotelluric (MT) data have increased dramatically and various 3-D forward and inversion codes are in use and some have become commonly available. Comparison of forward responses and inversion results is an important step for code testing and validation prior to ‘production’ use. The various codes use different mathematical approximations to the problem (finite differences, finite elements or integral equations), various orientations of the coordinate system, different sign conventions for the time dependence and various inversion strategies. Additionally, the obtained results are dependent on data analysis, selection and correction as well as on the chosen mesh, inversion parameters and regularization adopted, and therefore, a careful and knowledge-based use of the codes is essential. In 2008 and 2011, during two workshops at the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies over 40 people from academia (scientists and students) and industry from around the world met to discuss 3-D MT inversion. These workshops brought together a mix of code writers as well as code users to assess the current status of 3-D modelling, to compare the results of different codes, and to discuss and think about future improvements and new aims in 3-D modelling. To test the numerical forward solutions, two 3-D models were designed to compare the responses obtained by different codes and/or users. Furthermore, inversion results of these two data sets and two additional data sets obtained from unknown models (secret models) were also compared. In this manuscript the test models and data sets are described (supplementary files are available) and comparisons of the results are shown. Details regarding the used data, forward and inversion parameters as well as computational power are summarized for each case, and the main discussion points of the workshops are revi- wed. In general, the responses obtained from the various forward models are comfortingly very similar, and discrepancies are mainly related to the adopted mesh. For the inversions, the results show how the inversion outcome is affected by distortion and the choice of errors, as well as by the completeness of the data set. We hope that these compilations will become useful not only for those that were involved in the workshops, but for the entire MT community and also the broader geoscience community who may be interested in the resolution offered by MT.","0956-540X;0956540X","","10.1093/gji/ggt066","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8179980","Geomagnetic induction;Inverse theory;Magnetotelluric;Numerical solutions","","","","","","","","","","","June 2013","","OUP","OUP Journals & Magazines"

Gall","University of Zurich, Switzerland","2018 IEEE 25th International Conference on Software Analysis, Evolution and Reengineering (SANER)","20180405","2018","","","38","49","Automatic static analysis tools (ASATs) are tools that support automatic code quality evaluation of software systems with the aim of (i) avoiding and/or removing bugs and (ii) spotting design issues. Hindering their wide-spread acceptance are their (i) high false positive rates and (ii) low comprehensibility of the generated warnings. Researchers and ASATs vendors have proposed solutions to prioritize such warnings with the aim of guiding developers toward the most severe ones. However, none of the proposed solutions considers the development context in which an ASAT is being used to further improve the selection of relevant warnings. To shed light on the impact of such contexts on the warnings configuration, usage and adopted prioritization strategies, we surveyed 42 developers (69% in industry and 31% in open source projects) and interviewed 11 industrial experts that integrate ASATs in their workflow. While we can confirm previous findings on the reluctance of developers to configure ASATs, our study highlights that (i) 71% of developers do pay attention to different warning categories depending on the development context, and (ii) 63% of our respondents rely on specific factors (e.g., team policies and composition) when prioritizing warnings to fix during their programming. Our results clearly indicate ways to better assist developers by improving existing warning selection and prioritization strategies.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-4969-5; POD:978-1-5386-4970-1","10.1109/SANER.2018.8330195","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8330195","Code Review;Continuous Integration;Development Context;Empirical Study;Static Analysis","Computer bugs;Encoding;Interviews;Lead;Programming;Software;Tools","program debugging;program diagnostics;software quality","ASAT;ASATs vendors;automatic code quality evaluation;automatic static analysis tools;bugs removal;development context;high false positive rates;prioritization strategies;software systems;warning categories;warning selection;warnings configuration","","","","","","","","20-23 March 2018","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we investigate using text information to automatically detect duplicate pull-requests in GitHub. For a new-arriving pull-request, we compare the textual similarity between it and other existing pull-requests, and then return a candidate list of the most similar ones. We evaluate our approach on three popular projects hosted in GitHub, namely Rails, Elasticsearch and Angular.JS. The evaluation shows that about 55.3% -- 71.0% of the duplicates can be found when we use the combination of title similarity and description similarity.</p>","","","10.1145/3131704.3131725","","","Pull-request;code review;duplicate detection;textual similarity","","","","","","","","","","","23-23 Sept. 2017","","ACM","ACM Conferences"
"On the Influence of Human Factors for Identifying Code Smells: A Multi-Trial Empirical Study","R. M. d. Mello; R. F. Oliveira; A. F. Garcia","Banco do Brazil, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","2017 ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement (ESEM)","20171211","2017","","","68","77","Context: Code smells are symptoms in the source code that represent poor design choices. Professional developers often perceive several types of code smells as indicators of actual design problems. However, the identification of code smells involves multiple steps that are subjective in nature, requiring the engagement of humans. Human factors are likely to play a key role in the precise identification of code smells in industrial settings. Unfortunately, there is limited knowledge about the influence of human factors on smell identification. Goal: We aim at investigating whether the precision of smell identification is influenced by three key human factors, namely reviewer's professional background, reviewer's module knowledge and collaboration of reviewers during the task. We also aim at deriving recommendations for allocating human resources to smell identification tasks. Method: We performed 19 comparisons among different subsamples from two trials of a controlled experiment conducted in the context of an empirical study on code smell identification. One trial was conducted in industrial settings while the other had involved graduate students. The diversity of the samples allowed us to analyze the influence of the three factors in isolation and in conjunction. Results: We found that (i) reviewers' collaboration significantly increases the precision of smell identification, but (ii) some professional background is required from the reviewers to reach high precision. Surprisingly, we also found that: (iii) having previous knowledge of the reviewed module does not affect the precision of reviewers with higher professional background. However, this factor was influential on successful identification of more complex smells. Conclusion: We expect that our findings are helpful to support researchers in conducting proper experimental procedures in the future. Besides, they may also be useful for supporting project managers in allocating resources for smell identific- tion tasks.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4039-1; POD:978-1-5090-4040-7","10.1109/ESEM.2017.13","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8170086","code review;code smell identification;collaboration;context;human factors;replication","Collaboration;Human factors;Software measurement;Software systems;Tools","human factors;software maintenance;software quality","code smell identification;code smells;complex smells;human factors;human resources;multitrial empirical study;smell identification tasks","","","","","","","","9-10 Nov. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Given the large implications of architectural decisions, we do not know whether developers are aware of their changes' impact on the software's architecture, whether awareness leads to better changes, and whether automatically making developers aware would prevent degradation. Therefore, we use code review data of 4 open source systems to investigate the intent and awareness of developers when performing changes. We extracted 8,900 reviews for which the commits are available. 2,152 of the commits have changes in their computed architectural metrics, and 338 present significant changes to the architecture. We manually inspected all reviews for commits with significant changes and found that only in 38% of the time developers are discussing the impact of their changes on the architectural structure, suggesting a lack of awareness. Finally, we observed that developers tend to be more aware of the architectural impact of their changes when the architectural structure is improved, suggesting that developers should be automatically made aware when their changes degrade the architectural structure.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-2684-9; POD:978-1-5386-3976-4","10.1109/ASE.2017.8115622","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8115622","Code Reviews;Software Architecture","Computer architecture;Couplings;Degradation;History;Java;Measurement;Software systems","software architecture;software engineering;software maintenance;software metrics;software quality","architectural changes;architectural decisions;architectural impact;architectural structure;computed architectural metrics;software development lifecycle;time developers","","","","","","","","Oct. 30 2017-Nov. 3 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Based on the case study we have publicized anonymized research data and formulated four hypotheses pertaining to career paths of contributors in modern multi-company open source projects. We conjecture that(i) developers and reviewers are separate subpopulations with little movement between them, (ii-a) the turnover of the core reviewers is high and rapid, (ii-b) companies are interested in having core reviewers among their staff, and (iii) being a core reviewer is beneficial for career.Validity of those hypotheses in other multi-company open source projects should be investigated in the follow-up studies.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-0992-7; POD:978-1-5386-0993-4","10.1109/ICSME.2017.25","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8094459","OpenStack;career;code review;open source software","Bibliographies;Companies;Couplings;Databases;Engineering profession;Focusing;Software","human factors;personnel;public domain software;software engineering","OpenStack developers;career perspectives;code review career paths;code review hierarchy;multicompany open source projects;open source developers;software development companies;software engineers","","","","","","","","17-22 Sept. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Over the years, multiple tools have been proposed to help software developers conduct and manage code reviews. Some software organizations have been migrating from broadcast review technology to a more advanced unicast review approach such as Jira, but it is unclear if these unicast review technology leads to better code reviews. This paper empirically studies review data of five Apache projects that switched from broadcast based code review to unicast based, to understand the impact of review technology on review effectiveness and quality. Results suggest that broadcast based review is twice faster than review done with unicast based review technology. However, unicast's review quality seems to be better than that of the broadcast based. Our findings suggest that the medium (i.e., broadcast or unicast) technology used for code reviews can relate to the effectiveness and quality of reviews activities.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-6031-3; POD:978-1-5090-6032-0","10.1109/ICST.2017.27","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7927977","Apache;Bug-inducing Changes;Code Review;Empirical Study;Medium;Patches;Quality Assurance","Broadcast technology;Electronic mail;Switches;Unicast","software quality","Apache projects;broadcast review technology;code review;software organizations;software system;unicast review technology","","","","","","","","13-17 March 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Why are Commits Being Reverted?: A Comparative Study of Industrial and Open Source Projects","J. Shimagaki; Y. Kamei; S. McIntosh; D. Pursehouse; N. Ubayashi","Sony Mobile Commun. Inc., Japan","2016 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME)","20170116","2016","","","301","311","Software development is a cyclic process of integrating new features while introducing and fixing defects. During development, commits that modify source code files are uploaded to version control systems. Occasionally, these commits need to be reverted, i.e., the code changes need to be completely backed out of the software project. While one can often speculate about the purpose of reverted commits (e.g., the commit may have caused integration or build problems), little empirical evidence exists to substantiate such claims. The goal of this paper is to better understand why commits are reverted in large software systems. To that end, we quantitatively and qualitatively study two proprietary and four open source projects to measure: (1) the proportion of commits that are reverted, (2) the amount of time that commits that are eventually reverted linger within a codebase, and (3) the most frequent reasons why commits are reverted. Our results show that 1%-5% of the commits in the studied systems are reverted. Those commits that are eventually reverted linger within the studied codebases for 1-35 days (median). Furthermore, we identify 13 common reasons for reverting commits, and observe that the frequency of reverted commits of each reason varies broadly from project to project. A complementary qualitative analysis suggests that many reverted commits could have been avoided with better team communication and change awareness. Our findings made Sony Mobile's stakeholders aware that internally reverted commits can be reduced by paying more attention to their own changes. On the other hand, externally reverted commits could be minimized only if external stakeholders are involved to improve inter-company communication or requirements elicitation.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-3806-0; POD:978-1-5090-3807-7","10.1109/ICSME.2016.83","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7816476","code inspections;code review;mining software repository;revert;software evolution","Androids;Humanoid robots;Mobile communication;Mobile handsets;Software systems;Stakeholders","project management;public domain software;software engineering;software management;source code (software)","industrial project;large software systems;open source project;qualitative analysis;reverted commits;software development;software project;source code;version control systems","","","","","","","","2-7 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Safety standards promote the use of integrated formal methods when a single method cannot achieve the verification objective without specifying how. In this paper, we take on the problem of using outputs from integrated formal methods as evidence in assurance cases, which are used in certification of safety-critical systems. We first present two workflows that employ integrated formal methods - code review workflow and code coverage workflow - corresponding to two of the most important activities of the verification phase. Then, we show how each workflow and the outputs from its integrated formal methods can be used in creating an assurance argument.

Some key results include: (1) code review can identify common types of vulnerabilities; (2) while more experienced contributors authored the majority of the VCCs, the less experienced contributors' changes were 1.8 to 24 times more likely to be vulnerable; (3) the likelihood of a vulnerability increases with the number of lines changed, and (4) modified files are more likely to contain vulnerabilities than new files. Knowing which code changes are more prone to contain vulnerabilities may allow a security expert to concentrate on a smaller subset of submitted code changes. Moreover, we recommend that projects should: (a) create or adapt secure coding guidelines, (b) create a dedicated security review team, (c) ensure detailed comments during review to help knowledge dissemination, and (d) encourage developers to make small, incremental changes rather than large changes. </p>","","","10.1145/2635868.2635880","","","code review;inspection;open source;security defects;vulnerability","","","","","7","","","","","","16-21 Nov. 2014","","ACM","ACM Conferences"

Idea-generation is perhaps ten per cent of innovation; most of the work is on technology transfer and adoption. Chance plays a big role in creating opportunities (e.g., R&D involves a lot of luck), but a company's success depends on its ability to make opportunities more likely to occur, and to capitalize on those opportunities when they arise. Passionate individuals drive technology transfer more than does process; indeed, some people believe that the original researchers need to be involved all the way along the chain.

Our idea is to address this problem with identification of software developer's activities from a stream of interaction data in real time.

In an effort to characterize and understand these differences we examine two Google-led projects, Android and Chromium OS, three Microsoft projects, Bing, Office, and MS SQL, and projects internal to AMD. We contrast our findings with data taken from traditional software inspection conducted on a Lucent project and from open source software peer review on six projects, including Apache, Linux, and KDE. Our measures of interest include the review interval, the number of developers involved in review, and proxy measures for the number of defects found during review. We find that despite differences among projects, many of the characteristics of the review process have independently converged to similar values which we think indicate general principles of code review practice. We also introduce a measure of the degree to which knowledge is shared during review. This is an aspect of review practice that has traditionally only had experiential support. Our knowledge sharing measure shows that conducting peer review increases the number of distinct files a developer knows about by 66% to 150% depending on the project.

Modern Code Review (MCR), a lightweight and tool-based variant of conventional code review, is widely adopted in both open source and proprietary software projects. One challenge that impacts MCR is the assignment of appropriate developers to review a code change. Considering that there could be hundreds of potential code reviewers in a software project, picking suitable reviewers is not a straightforward task. A prior study by Thongtanunam et al. showed that the difficulty in selecting suitable reviewers may delay the review process by an average of 12 days. In this paper, to address the challenge of assigning suitable reviewers to changes, we propose a hybrid and incremental approach Tie which utilizes the advantages of both Text mIning and a filE location-based approach. To do this, Tie integrates an incremental text mining model which analyzes the textual contents in a review request, and a similarity model which measures the similarity of changed file paths and reviewed file paths. We perform a large-scale experiment on four open source projects, namely Android, OpenStack, QT, and LibreOffice, containing a total of 42,045 reviews. The experimental results show that on average Tie can achieve top-1, top-5, and top-10 accuracies, and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) of 0.52, 0.79, 0.85, and 0.64 for the four projects, which improves the state-of-the-art approach RevFinder, proposed by Thongtanunam et al., by 61%, 23%, 8%, and 37%, respectively.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-7532-0; USB:978-1-4673-7531-3","10.1109/ICSM.2015.7332472","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7332472","Modern Code Review;Path Similarity;Recommendation System;Text Mining","Accuracy;Analytical models;Computational modeling;Control systems;Feature extraction;Software;Text mining","configuration management;data mining;public domain software;text analysis","Android;LibreOffice;MCR;MRR;OpenStack;QT;TIE;filE location-based approach;mean reciprocal rank;modern code review;open source;software code review;software project;text mining model;textual content analysis;version control system","","6","","36","","","","Sept. 29 2015-Oct. 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While, according to the developers' programming techniques and safety awareness, there are many kinds of Web application security flaws and vulnerabilities hiding in the program. So it is very important to improve their reliability and security. Usually people use code review based on static or dynamic analysis to detect security vulnerabilities, but each method has shortcomings that can't overcome easily which can result in a big number of false positives and omission. To address this issue, this paper proposed a new framework of detecting security vulnerabilities of PHP web application. In this framework, we combine dynamic and static analysis to make full use of the advantages of the two, greatly improve the efficiency of detection. An implementation based on this framework has also been completed and it will also be presented in the paper.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-8872-3; Electronic:978-1-4799-8873-0; POD:978-1-4799-8874-7","10.1109/IMIS.2015.42","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7284959","PHP code review;code audit;dynamic analysis;static analysis","Data structures;Indexes;Security;Testing;Uniform resource locators;Virtual machining","Internet;telecommunication security","Internet applications;Internet services;PHP Web application;code review;dynamic analysis;safety awareness;security flaws;security vulnerabilities detection;static analysis","","","","12","","","","8-10 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our idea is to address this problem with identification of software developer's activities from a stream of interaction data in real time.

Process cube is a concept which falls at the intersection of OLAP cube and process mining. Process cube facilitates process mining from multiple-dimensions and enables comparison of process mining results across various dimensions. We present an application of process cube to software defect resolution process to analyze and compare process data from a multi-dimensional perspective. We present a framework, a novel perspective to mine software repositories using process cube. Each cell of process cube is defined by metrics from multiple process mining perspectives like control flow, time, conformance and organizational perspective. We conduct a case-study on Google Chromium project data in which the software defect resolution process spans three software repositories: Issue Tracking System (ITS), Peer Code Review System (PCR) and Version Control System (VCS). We define process cube with 9 dimensions as issue report timestamp, priority, state, closed status, OS, component, bug type, reporter and owner. We define hierarchies along various dimensions and cluster members to handle sparsity. We apply OLAP cube operations such as slice, dice, roll-up and drill-down, and create materialized sub log for each cell.

Iida","Kasetsart Univ., Bangkok, Thailand","2014 6th International Workshop on Empirical Software Engineering in Practice","20141206","2014","","","49","54","Modern Code Review (MCR) is an informal practice whereby reviewers virtually discuss proposed changes by adding comments through a code review tool or mailing list. It has received much research attention due to its perceived cost-effectiveness and popularity with industrial and OSS projects. Recent studies indicate there is a positive relationship between the number of review comments and code quality. However, little research exists investigating how such discussion impacts software quality. The concern is that the informality of MCR encourages a focus on trivial, tangential, or unrelated issues. Indeed, we have observed that such comments are quite frequent and may even constitute the majority. We conjecture that an effective MCR actually depends on having a substantive quantity of comments that directly impact a proposed change (or are ""useful""). To investigate this, a necessary first step requires distinguishing review comments that are useful to a proposed change from those that are not. For a large OSS projects such as our Qt case study, manual assessment of the over 72,000 comments is a daunting task. We propose to utilize semantic similarity as a practical, cost efficient, and empirically assurable approach for assisting with the manual usefulness assessment of MCR comments. Our case study results indicate that our approach can classify comments with an average F-measure score of 0.73 and reduce comment usefulness assessment effort by about 77%.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-6666-0; POD:978-1-4799-7139-8","10.1109/IWESEP.2014.11","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6976022","Modern Code Review;Software Quality;Text Mining","Data models;Manuals;Semantics;Software quality;Standards;Training;Training data","data mining;semantic networks;software quality","F-measure score;MCR comments;MCR discussion usefulness;OSS projects;code quality;code review tool;comment usefulness assessment;cost effectiveness;mailing list;modern code review;semantic similarity;software quality","","7","","10","","","","12-13 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we study the patch lifecycle of the Mozilla Fire fox project. The model of a patch lifecycle was extracted from both the qualitative evidence of the individual processes (interviews and discussions with developers), and the quantitative assessment of the Mozilla process and practice. We contrast the lifecycle of a patch in pre- and post-rapid release development. A quantitative comparison showed that while the patch lifecycle remains mostly unchanged after switching to rapid release, the patches submitted by casual contributors are disproportionately more likely to be abandoned compared to core contributors. This suggests that patches from casual developers should receive extra care to both ensure quality and encourage future community contributions.","1095-1350;10951350","Electronic:978-0-7695-4891-3; POD:978-1-4673-4536-1","10.1109/WCRE.2012.54","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6385140","Open source software;code review;patch lifecycle","Communities;Computer bugs;Educational institutions;Linux;Open source software;Process control;Switches","online front-ends;public domain software;software quality","Firefox case study;Mozilla Firefox project;code review process;contribution quality;open source projects;patch lifecycle;post-rapid release development;pre rapid release development;source code modification quality assessment;version control repository","","14","","15","","","","15-18 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We target three specific issues that must be addressed in such a certification procedure: the coding process, the code that is developed, and the skills of the coders. The coding process is driven by standards. The code is mechanically checked against the standards with the help of state-of-the-art static source code analyzers.

We have developed an adaptation of studio-based instruction for computing education called the <i>pedagogical code review</i>, which is modeled after the code inspection process used in the software industry. To evaluate its effectiveness, we carried out a quasi-experimental comparison of a ""studio-based"" CS 1 course with pedagogical code reviews and an identical ""traditional"" CS 1 course without pedagogical code reviews. We found no learning outcome differences between the two courses; however, we did observe two interesting attitudinal trends: (a) self-efficacy decreased more in the traditional course than in the studio-based course; and (b) peer learning decreased in the traditional course, but increased in the studio-based course.

However, finding a reviewer for certain code can be very challenging in Modern Code Review environment due to the difficulty of learning the expertise and availability of candidate reviewers. To tackle this problem, existing efforts mainly concern how to model a reviewer's expertise with the review history, and making recommendation based on how well a reviewer's expertise can meet the requirement of a review task. Nonetheless, as there are both explicit and implicit relations in data that affect whether a reviewer is suitable for a given task, merely modeling review expertise with explicit relations often fails to achieve expected recommendation accuracy. To that end, we propose a recommendation algorithm that takes implicit relations into account. Furthermore, we utilize a hybrid approach that combines latent factor models and neighborhood methods to capture implicit relations. Finally, we have conducted extensive experiments by comparing with the state-of-the-art methods using the data of 5 popular GitHub projects. The results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the comparing methods for all top-k recommendations and reaches a 15.3% precision promotion in top-1 recommendation.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-1389-4; POD:978-1-5386-1390-0","10.1109/SOFTWAREMINING.2017.8100850","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8100850","Code reviewer;collaborative filtering;github","Algorithm design and analysis;Collaboration;Data models;Feature extraction;Filtering;Software","collaborative filtering;recommender systems;software quality","candidate reviewers;code reviewer recommendation;hybrid approach;modern code review environment;recommendation accuracy;recommendation algorithm;review history;software quality assurance","","","","","","","","3-3 Nov. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to analyze the automatically pointed violations and the actual attentions which programmers paid to those violations, this paper proposes a novel metric-the Index of Programmers' Attention (IPA)-and conducts an empirical study focusing on the change patterns of violations over the releases of popular seven open source software products, under two research questions (RQs): (RQ1) What kind of coding violations are related to the parts that many programmers tend to improve? and what kind of coding violations are likely to be disregarded?; (RQ2) How can we reduce the meaningless violations for programmers by omitting disregarded coding violations? The empirical results showed the following findings: (1) important violations (having high IPA values) may vary from project to project; (2) there are some unimportant violations common to different projects, but they are a minority of automatically detected violations (about 12%). Therefore, while many violations may be made by a code checker, most of them are likely to be worthy in improving the code quality, and it is ineffective to reduce the violations by eliminating such unimportant violations.","1530-1362;15301362","Electronic:978-1-5090-5575-3; POD:978-1-5090-5576-0","10.1109/APSEC.2016.027","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7890579","Code Checker;Programmer Attention;Trend Analysis;Violation","Aerodynamics;Computer bugs;Data collection;Encoding;Java;Market research;Testing","public domain software;software quality;software reviews;source code (software)","IPA;change pattern;code quality;code review;coding violation;index of programmers attention;open source software product release","","","","","","","","6-9 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, contributors often leave a project before becoming a LTC because most contributors are volunteers. If contributors are motivated in their work in OSS projects, they might not leave the projects. In this study, we examine the phenomena involved in becoming a LTC in terms of motivation to continue in OSS projects. In particular, our target motivation is to understand what is involved in long-term contribution with other expert contributors. We study classifier to identify a LTC who will contribute patch submissions for more than one year based on collaboration in terms of the code review process.

While results obtained from analytics-based solutions suggested so far are promising, there are still several challenges associated with the adoption of software analytics into software development processes, as well as the development and integration of analytics tools in practical settings. We therefore propose a tutorial on software analytics. The tutorial will start with an introduction of software analytics.

If code smells are not systematically removed from a program, its continuous degradation may lead to either major maintenance effort or the complete redesign of the system. For several reasons, software developers introduce smells in their code as soon as they start to learn programming. If novice developers are ought to become either proficient programmers or skilled code reviewers, they should be early prepared to effectively identify code smells in existing programs. However, effective identification of code smells is often not a non-trivial task in particular to a novice developer working in isolation. Thus, the use of collaborative practices may have the potential to support developers in improving their effectiveness on this task at their early stages of their careers. These practices offer the opportunity for two or more developers analyzing the source code together and collaboratively reason about potential smells prevailing on it. Pair Programming (PP) and Coding Dojo Randori (CDR) are two increasingly adopted practices for improving the effectiveness of developers with limited or no knowledge in software engineering tasks, including code review tasks. However, there is no broad understanding about the impact of these collaborative practices on the effectiveness of code smell identification. This paper presents a controlled experiment involving 28 novice developers, aimed at assessing the effectiveness of collaborative practices in the identification of code smells. We compared PP and CDR with solo programming in order to better distinguish their impact on the effective identification of code smells. Our study is also the first in the literature to observe how novice developers work individually and together to identify smells. Our results suggest that collaborative practices contribute to the effectiveness on the identification of a wide range of code smells. Our findings - an also be used in practice to guide educators, researchers or teams on improving detection and training on code smell identification.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5086-4; POD:978-1-5090-5087-1","10.1109/SBCARS.2016.18","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7789840","Code Smells;Collaborative Practices;Controlled Experiment;Program Comprehension;Software Degradation","Collaboration;Degradation;Encoding;Programming profession;Software;Software engineering","software maintenance;software quality;software reviews;source code (software)","CDR;Coding Dojo Randori;PP;code review tasks;code smell identification;pair programming;software engineering tasks;software maintenance;software quality degradation;solo programming;source code","","2","","","","","","19-20 Sept. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We design our tool using client-server architecture, and then package the solution as a Google Chrome plug-in. Once the developer initiates a new pull request at GitHub, our tool automatically analyzes the request, mines two relevant histories, and then returns a ranked list of appropriate code reviewers for the request within the browser's context.

However, the counting process eliminates information about the temporal alignment of events leading to changes in the attributes count. Software quality teams could plan and prioritize their work more efficiently if they were aware of these temporal sequences and knew their frequency of occurrence. In this paper, we introduce a novel dataset mined from the Fire fox bug repository (Bugzilla) which contains information about the temporal alignment of developer interactions. Our dataset covers eight years of data from the Fire fox project on activities throughout the project's lifecycle. Some of these activities have not been reported in frequency-based or other temporal datasets. The dataset we mined from the Fire fox project contains new activities, such as reporter experience, file exchange events, code-review process activities, and setting of milestones.

Most such systems are designed around the central metaphor of the “issue” (bug, defect, ticket, feature, etc.), yet increasingly this model seems ill fitted to the practical needs of growing software projects; for example, our analysis of interviews with 20 Mozilla developers who use Bugzilla heavily revealed that developers face challenges maintaining a global understanding of the issues they are involved with, and that they desire improved support for situational awareness that is difficult to achieve with current issue management systems. In this paper we motivate the need for personalized issue tracking that is centered around the information needs of individual developers together with improved logistical support for the tasks they perform. We also describe an initial approach to implement such a system - extending Bugzilla - that enhances a developer's situational awareness of their working context by providing views that are tailored to specific tasks they frequently perform; we are actively improving this prototype with input from Mozilla developers.","0270-5257;02705257","Electronic:978-1-4673-3076-3; POD:978-1-4673-3075-6","10.1109/ICSE.2013.6606674","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6606674","","Computer bugs;Electronic mail;Interviews;Prototypes;Software;Software engineering;Target tracking","online front-ends;project management;software development management","Bugzilla;Mozilla developers;code review;collaborative bug fixing;developer situational awareness;history tracking;information needs;issue management system;issue tracking system personalization;logistical support;project management;software development;software project","","3","","20","","","","18-26 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Lifecycle models capture the dynamic nature of how various development artifacts change over time in a graphical form that can be easily understood and communicated. Lifecycle models enables reasoning of the underlying processes and dynamics of the artifacts being analyzed. In this paper we describe how lifecycle models can be generated and demonstrate how they can be applied to the code review process of a development project.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-6296-2; POD:978-1-4673-6295-5","10.1109/DAPSE.2013.6603803","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6603803","","Control systems;Data mining;Data models;Educational institutions;History;Software;Time measurement","meta data;software engineering","artifact lifecycle model extraction;code review process;metadata history;software development artifacts;software development project;software systems","","0","","2","","","","21-21 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A typical process of bug fixing consists of the following steps: 1) a user files a bug report, 2) the bug is assigned to a developer, 3) the developer fixes the bug, 4) changed code is reviewed and verified, and 5) the bug is resolved. Many studies have investigated the process of bug fixing. However, to the best of our knowledge, none has explicitly analyzed the interval between bug assignment and the time when bug fixing starts. After a bug assignment, some developers will immediately start fixing the bug while others will start bug fixing after a long period. We are blind on developer's delays when fixing bugs. This paper explores such delays of developers through an empirical study on three open source software systems. We examine factors affecting bug fixing time along three dimensions: bug reports, source code involved in the fix, and code changes that are required to fix the bug. We further compare different factors by descriptive logistic regression models. Our results can help development teams better understand factors behind delays, and then improve bug fixing process.","1095-1350;10951350","Electronic:978-0-7695-4891-3; POD:978-1-4673-4536-1","10.1109/WCRE.2012.32","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6385118","bug fixing process;bug report;change request;empirical software engineering;fixing time;mylyn","Computer bugs;Delay;Distributed Bragg reflectors;History;Logistics;Operating systems","program debugging;public domain software;regression analysis;software engineering","bug assignment;bug fixing;bug fixing time;bug report;bug resolution;code change;code review;code verification;descriptive logistic regression model;open source software system;software development process;source code","","14","","21","","","","15-18 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When realizing UML ports in object oriented languages, using objects for each port is one option. However, this approach causes runtime overhead and renders significant amount of additional generated code. To meet the performance constraints and decrease the costs of code reviews required in development of safety-critical real-time embedded software, more efficient approaches are required. In this article, we propose an approach, which introduces relatively less runtime overhead and results in more compact source code. A structural model defined with UML ports is transformed into a model that uses associations instead of objects to efficiently implement the UML port semantics with less lines of code. Achieved improvements and validation of the proposed approach is demonstrated by a case study; the design of an existing avionics software.","","Electronic:978-989-758-232-5; POD:978-1-5090-5898-3","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7954368","Embedded;Model;Object-Oriented;Port;Real-Time;Realization;Safety-Critical;Transformation;UML","Connectors;Object oriented modeling;Ports (Computers);Relays;Runtime;Software;Unified modeling language","Unified Modeling Language;aerospace computing;avionics;embedded systems;object-oriented languages;program verification;safety-critical software;source code (software)","UML port semantics;avionics software design;code reviews;compact source code;object oriented languages;performance constraints;real-time software;safety-critical real-time embedded software;structural model","","","","","","","","19-21 Feb. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A common industrial practice to identify code quality concerns early on are code reviews. While code reviews help to identify problems early on, they also impose costs on development and only take place after a code change is already completed. The goal of our research is to automatically identify code quality concerns while a developer is making a change to the code. By using biometrics, such as heart rate variability, we aim to determine the difficulty a developer experiences working on a part of the code as well as identify and help to fix code quality concerns before they are even committed to the repository. In a field study with ten professional developers over a two-week period we investigated the use of biometrics to determine code quality concerns. Our results show that biometrics are indeed able to predict quality concerns of parts of the code while a developer is working on, improving upon a naive classifier by more than 26% and outperforming classifiers based on more traditional metrics. In a second study with five professional developers from a different country and company, we found evidence that some of our findings from our initial study can be replicated. Overall, the results from the presented studies suggest that biometrics have the potential to predict code quality concerns online and thus lower development and evolution costs.","","Electronic:978-1-4503-3900-1; POD:978-1-5090-2071-3","10.1145/2884781.2884803","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7886925","","Biometrics (access control);Companies;Heart rate variability;Manuals;Software;Temperature measurement","software quality","biometrics;code quality prediction;code reviews;code understandability;heart rate variability;software development costs;software evolution costs","","1","","","","","","14-22 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This includes helping to select the best professionals for the debugging effort, improving the conditions for code inspections, and identify new directions to follow for training code reviewers. This paper presents an interdisciplinary study to analyze the brain activity during code inspection tasks using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which is a well-established tool in cognitive neuroscience research. We used several programs where realistic bugs representing the most frequent types of software faults found in the field were injected. The code inspectors involved in the research include programmers with different levels of expertise and experience in real code reviews. The goal is to understand brain activity patterns associated with code comprehension tasks and, more specifically, the brain activity when the code reviewer identifies a bug in the code ('eureka' moment), which can be a true positive or a false positive. Our results confirmed that brain areas associated with language processing and mathematics are highly active during code reviewing and shows that there are specific brain activity patterns that can be related to the decision-making moment of suspicion/bug detection. Importantly, the activity at the anterior insula region that we find to play a relevant role in the process of identifying software bugs is positively correlated to the precision of bug detection by the inspectors. This finding provides a new perspective on the role of this region on error awareness and monitoring and of its potential predictive value in predicting the quality of bug removing.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-9002-6; POD:978-1-4673-9003-3","10.1109/ISSRE.2016.53","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7774510","ODC;cognitive neuroscience;fRMI;software faults;software inspections","Brain;Computer bugs;Inspection;Magnetic resonance imaging;Neuroscience;Software;Software reliability","biomedical MRI;program debugging;software engineering;software reliability","WAP;activity functional patterns;anterior insula region;brain activity patterns;brain regions;bug removing quality prediction;code comprehension tasks;code inspections;code reviewing;cognitive neuroscience research;debugging effort;decision-making moment;error awareness;error monitoring;fMRI;functional magnetic resonance imaging;language processing;realistic bugs;software debugging;software development process;software faults;software reliability improvement;suspicion-bug detection","","","","","","","","23-27 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Application sharing and groupware for collaborative editing are widely used for collaborative tasks in distributed software development but considered from the awareness and flexibility aspect they are far off the co-located setting. To better support virtual team collaboration by improving tools for distributed software development it is neccesary to evaluate awareness and its impacts to certain collaborative situations. Awareness itself is an invisible phenomenon and due to its intangible nature cannot be easily observed or measured. Thus we recorded virtual teams using Saros, a groupware for distributed collaborative party programming, respectively VNC and now analyse these videos using the grounded theory methodology.

We present several experimental design options and discuss the pros and cons of each.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4345-1; POD:978-1-4577-0019-4","10.1109/ICSTW.2011.75","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5954465","assessing causal effects;experimental design;industrial systems;software fault prediction;software testing","Computer bugs;Fault detection;Measurement;Predictive models;Software;Software testing","program testing;software reliability;system recovery","code reviews;fault-prediction;prediction models;software developers;software quality improvement methods","","2","","8","","","","21-25 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

They are widely applied in numerous fields. However, hardly can we see a code recommender system for programmers though it is desperately expected. Raw data of the code are not so convenient to handle for the difference in structure and lack of relevance. Fortunately, in real world, there are abundant data affiliated to the code, such as context, tags, social relations of users and view histories. In this paper, we firstly formulate a new task of code recommendation. Then, we propose a hybrid linear algorithm for recommending source codes, in which we maximize the utility of multivariate heterogeneous auxiliary data with code. Experiments on the dataset from Code Review Community show that our proposed method works for the new code recommendation task.

Due to many factors, design choices that cause the overall code structure to decay may be made and implemented, so that benefits, such as reduced development time, can be obtained in the short term. In order to deal with these situations, the metaphor of technical debt emerged to allow such situations to be systematically managed. Although this concept is already known in academia, there are limited evidences that the industry widely adopts it. Therefore, this paper presents the results of a survey involving 74 participants that work in the Brazilian software industry, in order to understand why technical debt is introduced, eliminated and how it is managed in practice, with a focus on the code level. Our survey is not limited to the explicit management of technical debt but also includes the notion that the introduction of poor code without the awareness that it is a poor design choice can also become a debt. Such a code can be acknowledged as a debt to be paid as the software evolves. Our results show that overload of work and lack of time, together with pressure from the management, are the main reasons for the creation of technical debt. However, when participants evaluate other developers, they believe that inexperience also plays a key role. Moreover, the most effective practice to avoid the creation of technical debt is code review, in the opinion of participants.</p>","","","10.1145/3131151.3131164","","","Programming Best Practices;Survey;Technical Debt","","","","","","","","","","","20-22 Sept. 2017","","ACM","ACM Conferences"

Moreover, the generated code may change depending on the problem type, domain size, or target platform, making conventional code review or testing methods impractical. As a solution, we propose the integration of formal verification tools into the code generation process. We present a case study in which the CIVL verification tool is combined with the Devito finite difference framework that generates optimised stencil code for PDE solvers from symbolic equations.

One-Time Contributors (OTCs), who are on the very fringe of the peripheral developers, are largely unstudied despite offering unique insights into the development process. In a prior survey, we identified OTCs and discovered their motivations and barriers. Aims: The objective of this study is to corroborate the survey results and provide a better understand of OTCs. We compare OTCs to other peripheral and core contributors to determine whether they are distinct. Method: We mined data from the same code-review repository used to identify survey respondents in our previous study. After identifying each contributor as core, periphery, or OTC, we compared them in terms of patch size, time interval from submission to decision, the nature of their conversations, and patch acceptance rates. Results: We identified a continuum between core developers and OTCs. OTCs create smaller patches, face longer time intervals between patch submission and rejection, have longer review conversations, and face lower patch acceptance rates. Conversely, core contributors create larger patches, face shorter time intervals for feedback, have shorter review conversations, and have patches accepted at the highest rate. The peripheral developers fall in between the OTCs and the core contributors. Conclusion: OTCs do, in fact, face the barriers identified in our prior survey.

A variety of techniques have been used to build defect prediction models, including supervised and unsupervised methods. Recently, Yang et al.

However, little is known about relative performance of unsupervised and supervised models for effort-aware file-level defect prediction. Goal: Inspired by their work, we aim to investigate whether a similar finding holds in effort-aware file-level defect prediction. Method: We replicate Yang et al.'s study on PROMISE dataset with totally ten projects. We compare the effectiveness of unsupervised and supervised prediction models for effort-aware file-level defect prediction. Results: We find that the conclusion of Yang et al. [1] does not hold under within-project but holds under cross-project setting for file-level defect prediction. In addition, following the recommendations given by the best unsupervised model, developers needs to inspect statistically significantly more files than that of supervised models considering the same inspection effort (i.e., LOC). Conclusions: (a) Unsupervised models do not perform statistically significantly better than state-of-art supervised model under within-project setting, (b) Unsupervised models can perform statistically significantly better than state-ofart supervised model under cross-project setting, (c) We suggest that not only LOC but also number of files needed to be inspected should be considered when evaluating effort-aware filelevel defect prediction models.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4039-1; POD:978-1-5090-4040-7","10.1109/ESEM.2017.48","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8170121","Effortaware Defect Prediction;Inspection Effort;Replication Study","Data models;Inspection;Logistics;Measurement;Predictive models;Software;Software engineering","software quality","effort-aware change-level defect prediction;effort-aware file-level defect prediction;software defect models;supervised prediction models;unsupervised prediction models","","","","","","","","9-10 Nov. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Where there is money, there must be security, yet prior work on mobile money has identified discouraging vulnerabilities in the current ecosystem. We begin by arguing that the situation is not as dire as it may seem---many reported issues can be resolved by security best practices and updated mobile software. To support this argument, we diagnose the problems from two directions: (1) a large-scale analysis of existing financial service products and (2) a series of interviews with 7 developers and designers in Africa and South America. We frame this assessment within a novel, systematic threat model. In our large-scale analysis, we evaluate 197 Android apps and take a deeper look at 71 products to assess specific organizational practices. We conclude that although attack vectors are present in many apps, service providers are generally making intentional, security-conscious decisions. The developer interviews support these findings, as most participants demonstrated technical competency and experience, and all worked within established organizations with regimented code review processes and dedicated security teams.</p>","","","10.1145/3001913.3001919","","","Android;ICTD;finance;fraud;human factors;mBanking;mobile money","","","","","","","","","","","18-20 Nov. 2016","","ACM","ACM Conferences"

We find that mentees working on user facing, interdependent software form a balance of ties that facilitate both goals, while mentees working on non-user facing software mostly form ties important for building technical skill. Work practices that create opportunities for unstructured contact between mentees and community members, such as code review in a mentee cohort, can help to overcome this imbalance.

Automatically assigning the right solution providers to the maintenance task at hand is arguably as important as providing the right tool support for it, especially in the far too commonly found state of inadequate or obsolete documentation of large-scale software systems. Two maintenance tasks related to assignment and assistance to software developers and reviewers are addressed, and solutions are proposed. The key insight behind these proposed solutions is the analysis and use of micro-levels of human-to-code and human-to-human interactions (eg., code review). We analyzed code reviews that are managed by Gerrit and found different markers of developer expertise associated with the source code changes and their acceptance, time line, and human roles and feedback involved in the reviews. We formed a developer-expertise model from these markers and showed its application in bug triaging. Specifically, we derived a developer recommendation approach for an incoming change request, named rDevX , from this expertise model. Additionally, we present an approach, namely cHRev, to automatically recommend reviewers who are best suited to participate in a given review, based on their historical contributions as demonstrated in their prior reviews. Furthermore, a comparative study on other previous approaches for developer recommendation and reviewer recommendation was performed. The metrics recall and MRR were used to measure their quantitative effectiveness.

We first motivate our technique using an exploratory study with 10 commercial projects and 10 associated libraries external to those projects. Experiments using 17,115 pull requests from 10 commercial projects and six open source projects show that our technique provides 85%-92% recommendation accuracy, about 86% precision and 79%--81% recall in code reviewer recommendation, which are highly promising.

In this paper, we describe a property driven approach to hardware security, which allows automatic synthesis and verification of both qualitative and quantitative security properties. We address hardware security by enforcing information flow and statistical security properties.

Due to the new trend of integrating safe and secure functionalities into one separation kernel, security analysis of ARINC 653 as well as a formal specification with security proofs are thus significant for the development and certification of ARINC 653 compliant Separation Kernels (ARINC SKs). This paper presents a specification development and security analysis method for ARINC SKs based on refinement. We propose a generic security model and a stepwise refinement framework. Two levels of functional specification are developed by the refinement. A major part of separation kernel requirements in ARINC 653 are modeled, such as kernel initialization, two-level scheduling, partition and process management, and inter-partition communication. The formal specification and its security proofs are carried out in the Isabelle/HOL theorem prover.

OSS is generally developed by highly experienced developers who have multiple perspectives. However, previous studies have indicated that OSS has quality limitations in software maintainability. In general, OSS developers typically focus on achieving the correct functionality. In contrast, in addition to focusing on building software functionality, software engineering practices also focus on the structure of the software and on its maintainability. Code with a well-designed structure is more likely to result in high quality software. To better understand how peer code review can reduce ``code smells"" in existing OSS projects, we examined comments from code reviewers that identified code smells in OSS projects. This paper is a proof-of-concept that presents the preliminary results from an analysis of comments we obtained for two OSS projects, OpenStack and WikiMedia, both of which use the code review data repository called Gerrit. The preliminary results of this ongoing research show that code reviewers comment on only a small number of code smells.

In theory, security audits should find and remove the vulnerabilities before the code ever gets deployed. However, due to the enormous amount of code being produced, as well as a the lack of manpower and expertise, not all code is sufficiently audited. Thus, many vulnerabilities slip into production systems. A best-practice approach is to use a code metric analysis tool, such as Flawfinder, to flag potentially dangerous code so that it can receive special attention. However, because these tools have a very high false-positive rate, the manual effort needed to find vulnerabilities remains overwhelming. In this paper, we present a new method of finding potentially dangerous code in code repositories with a significantly lower false-positive rate than comparable systems. We combine code-metric analysis with metadata gathered from code repositories to help code review teams prioritize their work. The paper makes three contributions. First, we conducted the first large-scale mapping of CVEs to GitHub commits in order to create a vulnerable commit database. Second, based on this database, we trained a SVM classifier to flag suspicious commits. Compared to Flawfinder, our approach reduces the amount of false alarms by over 99 % at the same level of recall. Finally, we present a thorough quantitative and qualitative analysis of our approach and discuss lessons learned from the results. We will share the database as a benchmark for future research and will also provide our analysis tool as a web service.</p>","","","10.1145/2810103.2813604","","","machine learning;static analysis;vulnerabilities","","","","","1","","","","","","12-16 Oct. 2015","","ACM","ACM Conferences"

It is still hard to extract from the code a high-level representation that is sound, conveys design intent, and enables expressive constraints that can find security vulnerabilities. As a result, architecture-level approaches are less mature than code-level ones that extract low-level representations that are not directly intended for use by SIWs.</p> <p>In this paper, we compare an architecture-level approach with a code-level approach in terms of effectiveness (precision and recall) across test cases with injected vulnerabilities that range from coding bugs to architectural flaws. The evaluation shows that an architecture-level approach can uncover some security vulnerabilities with better precision and recall than a code-level approach. Moreover, it shows that the effectiveness of the approaches varies greatly based on whether the security vulnerability is a coding bug or an architectural flaw. These results may help SIWs select the right tools for the job of securing their systems.</p>","","","10.1145/2663887.2663905","","","","","","","","","","","","","","7-7 Nov. 2014","","ACM","ACM Conferences"

Endoh","Toshiba Corporation, Kawasaki, Japan","Proceedings of the tenth international conference on Aspect-oriented software development companion","20161111","2011","","","19","28","<p>Hardware-design requirements are becoming increasingly complex. Accordingly, the hardware developer is also beginning to use modern programming languages instead of traditional hardware description languages. However, modularity of the current hardware design has not changed from that of the traditional design. In this paper, we first conducted empirical investigation by interviews with real-world developers of circuit products, and confirmed that there exist cross-cutting concerns in actual products. The cross-cutting concerns fall into two types: one in common with software development and one specific to hardware design. In light of these results, this paper proposes ASystemC, an AOP extension for the hardware description language SystemC. ASystemC provides AOP features based on the AspectJ-like pointcut-advice mechanism. The design principle of ASystemC is practicality; we designed ASystemC to accept existing SystemC source code, and to weave aspects by using source-to-source conversion that outputs human-readable SystemC code. This design allows a user to utilize not only existing codes but also the existing knowledge and development process, as much as possible. As a result, ASystemC does not require modification of the existing source code review process and source analysis/manipulation tools, even if there is a developer unfamiliar with ASystemC in a development team. In addition, we confirmed the practicality and fiexibility of ASystemC through case studies: estimation of circuit size by using simulation, feature-configurable products and LTL verification. These cases are abstracted from actual problems in our products. They require not only code-level changes but also structural changes.</p>","","","10.1145/1960314.1960322","","","hardware description language;systemc","","","","","2","1","","","","","21-25 March 2011","","ACM","ACM Conferences"

Coding conventions define a consistent syntactic style, fostering readability and hence maintainability. When collaborating, programmers strive to obey a project’s coding conventions. However, one third of reviews of changes contain feedback about coding conventions, indicating that programmers do not always follow them and that project members care deeply about adherence. Unfortunately, programmers are often unaware of coding conventions because inferring them requires a global view, one that aggregates the many local decisions programmers make and identifies emergent consensus on style. We present NATURALIZE, a framework that learns the style of a codebase, and suggests revisions to improve stylistic consistency. NATURALIZE builds on recent work in applying statistical natural language processing to source code. We apply NATURALIZE to suggest natural identifier names and formatting conventions. We present four tools focused on ensuring natural code during development and release management, including code review. NATURALIZE achieves 94 % accuracy in its top suggestions for identifier names.

The aim is to discover runtime process, analyze performance and perform conformance verification, using process mining tools like ProM and Disco, for single software repository and processes spanning across multiple repositories. Application of process mining to software repositories has recently gained interest due to availability of vast data generated during software development and maintenance. Process data are embodied in repositories which can be used for analysis to improve the efficiency and capability of process, however, involves a lot of challenges which have not been addressed so far. Project team defines workflow, design process and policies for tasks like issue tracking (defect or feature enhancement), peer code review (review the submitted patch to avoid defects before they are injected) etc. to streamline and structure the activities. The reality may not be the same as defined because of imperfections so the extent of non-conformance needs to be measured. We propose a research framework `Nirikshan' to process mine the data of software repositories from multiple perspectives like process, organizational, data and time. We apply process mining on software repositories to derive runtime process map, identify and remove inefficiencies and imperfections, extend the capabilities of existing software engineering tools to make them more process aware, and understand interaction pattern between various contributors to improve the efficiency of project. </p>","","","10.1145/2591062.2591080","","","Business Process Intelligence;Empirical Software Engineering and Measurements;Mining Software Repositories;Open-Source Software;Process Mining","","","","","","","","","","","May 31 2014-June 7 2014","","ACM","ACM Conferences"

However, the counting process eliminates information about the temporal alignment of events leading to changes in the attributes count. Software quality teams could plan and prioritize their work more efficiently if they were aware of these temporal sequences and knew their frequency of occurrence.</p> <p>In this paper, we introduce a novel dataset mined from the Firefox bug repository (Bugzilla) which contains information about the temporal alignment of developer interactions. Our dataset covers eight years of data from the Firefox project on activities throughout the project's lifecycle.

The dataset we mined from the Firefox project contains new activities, such as reporter experience, file exchange events, code-review process activities, and setting of milestones.

However, the adoption of code inspection in industry is far less than it should be, which may lead to many novice inspectors in industry. For these novice inspectors, a suitable reading technique should be of the first step to begin this quality journey. While reports indicated that Checklist-Based Reading (CBR) and Ad Hoc Reading (AHR) had been the most adopted inspection techniques in industry, we deem it is necessary to investigate these two techniques first. In this paper, we present a case study of the adoption of code reading techniques in one small-sized software company. In this study, five engineers used different techniques (i.e., CBR vs. AHR) to read source code in 20 modules. Both quantitative data and qualitative data are collected during the case study. Initial analysis of these data indicates that industrial novice inspectors using CBR tended to have a lower reading speed than those using AHR. Both techniques could help these novice inspectors to remove a certain portion of defects during code review, and compared to AHR approach, CBR may help them find larger percentage of defects. However, there still exist several issues, for example, missing large portion of review-removable defects could not be avoided for novice inspectors. What's more, CBR may limit reviewers' ability to find defects outside the checklist, and to establish effective checklist remains a big challenge for novice inspectors. Besides, both internal factors (e.g., faith in inspection to achieve high quality) as well as external factors (e.g., schedule pressure) may also impact novice inspectors to adopt code reading.</p>","","","10.1145/2601248.2601280","","","code reading;industrial case study;novice inspectors","","","","","","","","","","","13-14 May 2014","","ACM","ACM Conferences"

Today's medical devices are based on embedded architecture, with software used to control the underlying hardware. They are highly critical since errors in the software can endanger end users such as patients and medics. Medical devices should be designed and manufactured in such a way that when used, they perform as intended and they ensure a high level of safety. Current industrial practices are based on testing processes to check if the software meets the specifications and if it fulfills its purpose. However, testing does have several disadvantages that limit the reliability of this verification and validation process. Testing cannot guarantee that a device will function properly under all conditions and bugs can never be completely identified withing a program. Several attempts have already been made to provide standards for the formal verification of safety properties of medical devices, initiated by the Generic Infusion Pump project [2]. Our work is a collaboration between Objet Direct R&D and Fresenius [1]. Fresenius is a leading international health care group which produces and markets pharmaceuticals and medical devices. We aim to investigate innovative methods for software development, validation and verification. We study existing results provided amongst others by [3, 4] which we intend to extend by analyzing the Fresenius Infusion Pump (FIP) software. FIP automatizes the delivery process of fluid medical solution into patient's body. Its design is based on three layers. The highest level is the user interface and consists of three components, the administration protocol, the application system and the power management. The middle level consists of the pumping control components and the lowest level contains driver components such as Door, Watchdog, Optical Disk, Motor. FIP is modeled in UML (a total of 100 state machines) and the requirements are written in natural language. The implementation of the model is done in C- + with automatic code generation. For the V&V process, software testing checks if the implementation meets the requirements using fault scenarios written in UML. The main objective of this project is to use model-based design for migrating from software testing to formal based solution for verifying the Fresenius Infusion Pump. The goal is to use model checking technologies in order to verify requirements and eliminate bugs during the design process. Several faulty design patterns have already been identified to be caused by deadlocks, lost signal events, stack overflow, violation of real-time properties, incoherent behavior of UML state machines. We present and analyze the case study of the FIP's Motor component, a driver component of the lowest level. Its interest lies on the fact that while the Motor Control is stopped, the Motor Driver is still running. This faulty behavior was detected during the test checks and bug was partially corrected in code review.","","Electronic:978-1-4503-1996-6; POD:978-1-4503-1996-6","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6604031","","Computer bugs;Medical services;Pumps;Safety;Software;Testing;Unified modeling language","biomedical equipment;embedded systems;health and safety;reliability","C++ language;FIP motor component;Generic Infusion Pump project;UML model;automatic code generation;embedded architecture;faulty design patterns;formal analysis;formal verification;fresenius infusion pump;industrial practices;medical devices;patient safety;safety property;testing processes;validation process;verification reliability","","0","","4","","","","8-11 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Invited talk: How the Fundamental Assurance Question pervades certification","M. Feather","Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology","2013 IEEE International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering Workshops (ISSREW)","20131219","2013","","","1","1","Assurance Cases are promoted as a means by which to present an argument for why a system is sufficiently dependable (alternate terms for the same concept include “Dependability Cases”, “Safety Cases” when the concern is safety, “Security Cases”, etc.). The purpose of such an argument is typically to inform a decision maker, often in the context of a key certification decision, so he/she will be better able to make that decision. Examples of such decisions include whether to deploy a system, whether to make an upgrade to an existing system, whether to advance a system to the next phase in its development. Assurance Cases are widely practiced in Europe, and are receiving growing attention in North America. For software systems in particular, an assurance-case-based approach is often contrasted to a standards-based approach, the latter being characterized as more “prescriptive” in specifying the process and techniques to be applied to sufficiently assure software. The proponents of an assurance-case-based approach point out that the need to construct a sufficiently convincing Assurance Case puts the onus on the provider of the software to present the argument for its dependability, as compared to putting the onus on the regulator to have described in advance a sufficient process to be followed by the provider in their development of software. The distinction is not as clear-cut as it might at first seem. Both approaches have the need to assess by how much the outcomes of assurance activities (e.g., testing; code review; fault tree analysis; model-checking) raise confidence in decisions made about the system. For a standards-based approach, how is it possible to determine whether the required standard practice can be relaxed or waived entirely, when an alternate approach can be substituted, when additional activities are warranted? These determinations hinge on an understanding of the role of assurance act- vities, and the information conveyed by their outcome. These questions will arise more often and become more urgent to answer in the evolving world mentioned in the Call for Papers. For an assurance-case-based approach the outcome of an assurance activity will be evidence located within the assurance case, which makes it easier to see the role it plays in the overall assurance argument, but the same question arises — what is its information contribution to confidence? Distilling these gives the “Fundamental Assurance Question,” namely how much do assurance activities contribute to raising decision confidence about system qualities, such as safety? These questions — and an intriguing start at answering them — will be the focus of this talk.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-2552-0; POD:978-1-4799-2553-7","10.1109/ISSREW.2013.6688831","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6688831","","","","","","0","","","","","","4-7 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In addition, workflow optimization can significantly reduce cost and increase efficiency and productivity. In this paper, we present RadStream: a web-based retrospective, exploratory, interactive data visualization tool that provides a comprehensive overview of the radiology department's daily activities. We worked closely with radiology staff to analyze the department workflow and classify the analytical tasks required by domain experts in order to inform the design of the tool, and together we abstracted the steps and factors involved in the clinical imaging process. The visual representation emphasizes the time interval between the different steps and uses color-coding to denote the status of a process (on-time, acceptably late, late) in compliance with standard radiology turnaround times (TATs). RadStream is an ongoing research project. Its main focus is on monitoring performance with special attention to duration, delays, and compliance with standard TATs. RadStream is currently undergoing evaluation by radiology staff using hospital data and real scenarios to evaluate its effectiveness, and the initial feedback received is very promising. Working with domain experts, we seek to provide a tool that helps monitor and improve the radiology department's activities. And based on a few review sessions with staff radiologists, we sensed a general excitement about RadStream as a quality assurance tool. We have also collected some constructive feedback we can build upon for future releases.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-3187-4; POD:978-1-5386-3188-1","10.1109/VAHC.2017.8387543","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8387543","Radiology;temporal data;visual analytics in healthcare;workflow","Data visualization;Imaging;Medical services;Production;Radiology;Tools;Visualization","","","","","","","","","","1-1 Oct. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

SLASH aims to help students review concepts in lectures slides using flash cards automatically generated from the slides. Many courses in our program have weekly quizzes and students can get stressed quite easily. So we hope that SLASH can make the process of reviewing lectures more fun and interesting to the students. Extracting concepts from lectures slides is itself an interesting but challenging problem, since the contents of the slides may be fragmented (e.g., point-based, with an incomplete sentence for each point) and noisy (e.g., containing formulas and codes). Past research on text mining has tried to ""glue"" together the points to construct a grammatically correct sentence, which is then used to extract concepts and relationships. In contrast, we focus on discovering popular concepts in the slides and generating flash cards with (just) sufficient contexts to help students recall the concepts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on the automatic generation of concept-based flash cards from lecture slides. In the presentation, we will show our preliminary work, example flash cards, student feedback, and challenges in developing SLASH. We believe that SLASH may benefit all instructors who are using PowerPoint for lecture presentation, and may be used to largely stimulate students' interests in learning the subjects.</p>","","","10.1145/3159450.3162224","","","concepts;flash cards;knowledge discovery;lecture slides;natural language processing","","","","","","","","","","","21-24 Feb. 2018","","ACM","ACM Conferences"

To achieve such a vision, information has to be collected from machines and products throughout a smart factory. Smart factories are defined as flexible and fully connected factories that are able to make use of constant streams of data from operations and production systems. In such scenarios, the arguably most popular way for identifying and tracking objects is by adding labels or tags, which have evolved remarkably over the last years: from pure hand-written labels to barcodes, QR codes, and RFID tags. The latest trend in this evolution is smart labels which are not only mere identifiers with some kind of internal storage, but also sophisticated context-aware tags with embedded modules that make use of wireless communications, energy efficient displays, and sensors. Therefore, smart labels go beyond identification and are able to detect and react to the surrounding environment. Moreover, when the industrial Internet of Things paradigm is applied to smart labels attached to objects, they can be identified remotely and discovered by other Industry 4.0 systems, what allows such systems to react in the presence of smart labels, thus triggering specific events or performing a number of actions on them. The amount of possible interactions is endless and creates unprecedented industrial scenarios, where items can talk to each other and with tools, machines, remote computers, or workers. This paper, after reviewing the basics of Industry 4.0 and smart labels, details the latest technologies used by them, their applications, the most relevant academic and commercial implementations, and their internal architecture and design requirements, providing researchers with the necessary foundations for developing the next generation of Industry 4.0 human-centered smart label applications.","","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2833501","Agencia Estatal de Investigaci&#243;n of Spain; ERDF funds of the EU (AEI/FEDER, UE); Xunta de Galicia; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8355491","IIoT;Industry 40;IoT;Smart labels;cyber-physical system;human-centered design;human-computer interface;smart objects;traceability;tracking","Industries;Internet of Things;Production facilities;Production systems;Real-time systems;Smart manufacturing","Internet of Things;factory automation;manufacturing systems;production engineering computing","Industry 4.0;flexible connected factories;fully connected factories;human-centered IoT-connected smart labels;smart factory;smart label applications;smart production systems","","","","","","","20180507","2018","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In our recent Software Engineering research, we investigated on the design of novel AI methods to facilitate all three major phases in software engineering: development, operation, and analysis. In this talk, I will first introduce the AI techniques we employed, including machine learning framework, classification, clustering, matrix factorization, topic modeling, deep learning, and parallel computing platform. Then I will explain the challenges in each phase and describe our recently proposed methodologies. First in development phase, we suggested an automated code completion technique via deep learning. Our technique learns the code style from lots of existing code bases, and recommends the most suitable token based on the trained deep learning model and current coding context. Besides, to help developers in conducting effective logging, we designed a tool named LogAdvisor, which tells developers whether they should write a logging statement in the current code block or not. Secondly, in operation phase, we implemented a continuous and passive authentication method for mobile phones based on user touch biometrics. Different from the traditional password authentication scheme, our method can recognize malicious attackers based on abnormal user behaviors. Moreover, we developed PAID, which automatically prioritizes app issues by mining user reviews. Finally, in analysis phase, we designed systematic data analytics techniques for software reliability prediction. Besides, to make full use of the crucial runtime information, we proposed effective methods for every step in log analysis, including log parsing, feature extraction, and log mining. Furthermore, we developed a CNN-based defect prediction method to help developers find the buggy code. In the end, we expect to establish a comprehensive framework for systematic employment of AI techniq- es in the Software Engineering paradigm.</p>","","","10.1145/3184407.3184440","","","artificial intelligence;software engineering","","","","","","","","","","","9-13 April 2018","","ACM","ACM Conferences"

In particular, accuracy measures such as precision and recall have only been roughly estimated, due both to problems in creating a validated clone benchmark against which tools can be compared, and to the manual effort required to hand check large numbers of candidate clones. In order to cope with this issue, over the last 10 years we have been working towards building cloning benchmarks for objectively evaluating clone detection tools. Beginning with our WCRE 2008 paper, where we conducted a modestly large empirical study with the NiCad clone detection tool, over the past ten years we have extended and grown our work to include several languages, much larger datasets, and model clones in languages such as Simulink. From a modest set of 15 C and Java systems comprising a total of 7 million lines in 2008, our work has progressed to a benchmark called BigCloneBench with eight million manually validated clone pairs in a large inter-project source dataset of more than 25,000 projects and 365 million lines of code. In this paper, we present a history and overview of software clone detection benchmarks, and review the steps of ourselves and others to come to this stage. We outline a future for clone detection benchmarks and hope to encourage researchers to both use existing benchmarks and to contribute to building the benchmarks of the future.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-4969-5; POD:978-1-5386-4970-1","10.1109/SANER.2018.8330194","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8330194","","Benchmark testing;Cloning;Reliability;Software measurement;Software systems;Tools","software maintenance","NiCad clone detection tool;candidate clones;clone detection tools;cloning benchmarks;software clone detection benchmarks","","","","","","","","20-23 March 2018","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Often, the exploration and understanding of large code bases is also a difficult task for experienced developers. Recently, semantic parsers and advances in research areas primarily investigated within the field of natural language human-robot interaction, have shown to be potentially useful for end-user development supported by natural language communication. Hence, this paper provides a structured review and categorization of approaches to ease software development, both for professional software programmers and for end-users with no prior programming skills.

"Large scale clone detection, analysis, and benchmarking: An evolutionary perspective (Keynote)","C. K. Roy","Department of Computer Science, University of Saskatchewan, Canada","2018 IEEE 12th International Workshop on Software Clones (IWSC)","20180329","2018","","","1","1","Copying a code fragment and then reusing it by pasting and adapting (e.g., adding/modifying/deleting statements) is a common practice in software development, which results in a significant amount of duplicated code in software systems. Developers consider cloning as one of the principled re-engineering approaches and often intentionally practice cloning for a variety of reasons such as faster development, avoiding risk by reusing stable old code, or for time pressure. On the other hand, duplicated code poses a number of threats to the maintenance of software systems such as clones are the #1 “bad smell” in Flower's refactoring list and several recent studies including studies with industrial systems show that although for many cases clones are not really harmful, and even could be useful for some cases, they could be also detrimental to software maintenance. For example, reusing a fragment containing unknown bugs may result in bugs propagation, or any changes in requirements involving a cloned fragment may lead to changes to all the similar fragments to it, multiplying the work to be done. Furthermore, inconsistent changes to the cloned fragments during any updating processes may lead to severe unexpected behaviour. Software clones are thus considered to be one of the major contributors to the high software maintenance cost, which could be up to 80% of total software development cost. The era of Big Data has introduced new applications for clone detection. For example, clone detection has been used to find similar mobile applications, to intelligently tag code snippets, to identify code examples, and so on from large inter-project repositories. The dual role of clones in software development and maintenance, along with these many emerging new applications of clone detection, has led to a great many clone detection tools and analysis frameworks. In this keynote talk, I will review the cloning literature to date, in particular,- I will talk about our recent work on large scale clone detection, and the challenges in evaluating such clone detectors and how we have overcome them at least in part with our BigCloneBench and Mutation framework. I will then talk about the recent advances in clone analysis and management along with a vision for a comprehensive clone management system.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-6430-8; POD:978-1-5386-6431-5","10.1109/IWSC.2018.8327311","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8327311","","","","","","","","","","","","20-20 March 2018","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Syntactically similar clones can often be encountered in practice. The same is not clear for only functionally similar clones (FSC). We conducted an exploratory survey among developers to investigate whether they encounter functionally similar clones in practice and whether there is a difference in their inclination to remove them to syntactically similar clones. Of the 34 developers answering the survey, 31 have experienced FSC in their professional work, and 24 have experienced problems caused by FSCs. We found no difference in the inclination and reasoning for removing FSCs and syntactically similar clones.

Grid disturbances such as voltage dips cause islanding of wind farms on the way to protect its apparatus from damage due to a high current flowing. The grid stability will suffer due to the islanding of large-scale wind farms. Wind farms should keep on connecting to the grid during low voltages for a specific time [low voltage ride through (LVRT) capability] to support the grid stability restoring. LVRT capability of permanent magnet synchronous generator driven directly by a variable speed wind turbine (PMSG-VSWT) can be realised by modifying the control of grid side converter (GSC), machine side converter (MSC), pitch angle control, or using the existing energy storage system. This study presents a review of recent proposed improvements to enhance the LVRT capability of PMSG-VSWT.

All these problems can be solved with the help of electronic digital signature (hereinafter-EDS). It ensures the integrity of information, its confidentiality, authenticity and the origin. EDS is widely used in various commercial and governmental organizations that are obliged to follow the state standard GOST R 34.10-2012 ""Information technology.

Due to the fact that EDS is based on a special hash function, the authors of this article have also reviewed the state standards GOST R 34.11-2012 and GOST R 34.11-1994. To estimate hash function generation time, the Python Code which uses the Pygost Library has been written. Furthermore, hacking complexity assessments of the algorithms themselves have been realized. Therefore, estimations of speed and performance procedures generation and signature verification have been made and the hacking complexity assessments of the Russian state standards are realized. The approximate durations of forced entry are calculated and the advantage of the new state standard GOST R 34.10-2012 is justified. As a result of the analysis the relevance, the reliability and the complexity of the state standard GOST R 34.10-2012 have been turned out.

The performance of object sync protocols heavily relies on two key parameters: r (number of replicas for each object) and n (number of objects hosted by each storage node). In existing tutorials and demos, the configurations are usually <formula><tex>$r = 3$</tex></formula> and <formula><tex>$n < 1000$</tex></formula> by default, and the sync process seems to perform well. However, we discover in data-intensive scenarios, e.g., when <formula><tex>$r > 3$</tex></formula> and <formula><tex>$n gg 1000$</tex></formula>, the sync process is significantly delayed and produces massive network overhead, referred to as the sync bottleneck problem. By reviewing the source code of OpenStack Swift, we find that its object sync protocol utilizes a fairly simple and network-intensive approach to check the consistency among replicas of objects. Hence in a sync round, the number of exchanged hash values per node is <formula><tex>$Theta(n times r)$</tex></formula>. To tackle the problem, we propose a lightweight and practical object sync protocol, LightSync, which not only remarkably reduces the sync overhead, but also preserves high reliability and eventual consistency. LightSync derives this capability from three novel building blocks: 1) Hashing of Hashes, which aggregates all the h hash values of each data partition into a single but representative hash value with the Merkle tree; 2) Circular Hash Checking, which checks the consistency of different partition replicas by only sending the aggregated hash value to the clockwise neighbor; and 3) Failed Neighbor Handling, which properly detects and handles node failures with moderate overhead to effectively strengthen the robustness of Li- htSync. The design of LightSync offers provable guarantee on reducing the per-node network overhead from <formula><tex>$Theta(n times r)$</tex></formula> to <formula><tex>$Theta (frac{n}{h})$</tex></formula>. Furthermore, we have implemented LightSync as an open-source patch and adopted it to OpenStack Swift, thus reducing the sync delay by up to <formula><tex>$879 times$</tex></formula> and the network overhead by up to <formula><tex>$47.5 times$</tex></formula>.","1045-9219;10459219","","10.1109/TPDS.2018.2810179","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8303732","Cloud storage;OpenStack Swift;object synchronization;performance bottleneck","Cloud computing;Delays;Electronic mail;Open source software;Protocols;Reliability;Synchronization","","","","","","","","","20180227","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Though several empirical studies on the COSMIC method verify that COSMIC Function Points (CFPs) successfully accomplished the goal of being applicable to a wide range of application domains and that its size correlate well with effort over a very wide range of sizes, one study of telecom switching software noticed that the correlation between CFPs and cost is very low for small projects (5 CFPs or less). The COSMIC method does not explicitly size data manipulations (such as, mathematical algorithms), which causes it to be less effective for mathematically-intensive software. IFPUG's FPs method has the same drawback of not explicitly measuring mathematical operations, but IFPUG developed the Software Non-Functional Assessment Process (SNAP) to complement a project's functional size. This empirical analysis will determine whether CFPs can be an effective size metric for small, maintenance tasks (between 2 and 12 CFPs) using a dataset consisting of Unified Code Count (UCC)1's maintenance tasks. Additionally, this analysis will consider whether using IFPUG's SNAP with COSMIC's FPs can lead to better effort estimates, as the former provides a method to measure data manipulation. The authors found that tasks adding new features require a different effort estimate model from those that modify existing features.</p>","","","10.1145/3172871.3172874","","","CFPs;COCOMO;COSMIC Function Points;Cost Estimation;Effort Estimation;Function Point Analysis;IFPUG;Local Calibration;Project Management;Software Maintenance;Software Non-Functional Assessment Process","","","","","","","","","","","9-11 Feb. 2018","","ACM","ACM Conferences"

The public release of several datasets and code for vision algorithms has facilitated rapid progress in this area over the last few years. However, directly comparing re-id algorithms reported in the literature has become difficult since a wide variety of features, experimental protocols, and evaluation metrics are employed. In order to address this need, we present an extensive review and performance evaluation of single- and multi-shot re-id algorithms. The experimental protocol incorporates the most recent advances in both feature extraction and metric learning. To ensure a fair comparison, all of the approaches were implemented using a unified code library that includes 11 feature extraction algorithms and 22 metric learning and ranking techniques. All approaches were evaluated using a new large-scale dataset that closely mimics a real-world problem setting, in addition to 16 other publicly available datasets: VIPeR, GRID, CAVIAR, DukeMTMC4ReID, 3DPeS, PRID, V47, WARD, SAIVT-SoftBio, CUHK01, CHUK02, CUHK03, RAiD, iLIDSVID, HDA+ and Market1501.

"Heuristics for vehicle routing problems: Current challenges and future prospects","T. Vidal","Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro Brazil","Proceedings of the Eighth International Symposium on Information and Communication Technology","20180219","2017","","","6","6","<p>Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP) involve designing least-cost delivery routes to visit a geographically-dispersed set of customers. Over the past 60 years, this class of problems has been the subject of considerable work, summing up to thousands of articles. In 2017, we can reasonably say that the classical capacitated VRP (with only capacity constraints) is fairly well solved by metaheuristic techniques. Yet, the research on VRPs keeps on expanding even further, as a consequence of the increasing diversity of applications, which bring forth new difficult constraints, objectives, and combined decisions to account for customers needs, vehicle and network restrictions, and to better integrate VRP optimization in the decision chains. Moreover, with the advent of collaborative logistics, green initiatives, smart cities, multi-modal transport, in contexts where multiples stakeholders and conflicting objectives have to be considered jointly, or in the presence of dynamic problems with a short response time, the efficient resolution of these problems becomes even more critical. In this talk, we will review some of the most challenging and recent VRP variants, and examine the heuristic solution techniques which are developed to tackle them. We will study the close connections between the structure of the problem decision sets, and the associated solution methods, showing how modern heuristics can effectively perform a search in a reduced space, defined by fewer groups of decision variables. Finally, a key challenge is to progress towards unified solution methods, which are not tailored for one single problem, but instead designed to solve a wide collection of problem variants with different constraints and objectives. For this purpose, we expose some of the main principles of the Unified Hybrid Genetic Search (UHGS), which has been recently extended to obtain state-of-the-art results --in a single code base-- for more than 50 difficult variants of vehicle routing and arc - outing problems.</p>","","","10.1145/3155133.3155139","","","","","","","","","","","","","","7-8 Dec. 2017","","ACM","ACM Conferences"

Given that manual processes are often empirical and subjective, we begin by formally defining a metric, which extends recognized best practice from code coverage analysis strategies to generate tests that adequately cover the requirements. We then implement it in an automated requirements testing procedure and apply it in a case study with industrial partners.

We solve three challenges: (1) How to create a secondary, higher-level specification that can be effectively reviewed by processor designers who are not experts in formal verification; (2) How to avoid common-mode failures between the specifications; and (3) How to automatically verify the two specifications against each other. </p> <p> One of the most important specifications for software verification is the processor specification since it defines the behaviour of machine code and of hardware protection features used by operating systems. We demonstrate our approach on ARM's v8-M Processor Specification, which is intended to improve the security of Internet of Things devices. Thus, we focus on establishing the security guarantees the architecture is intended to provide.

Firmware had been used to define the software code reside in ROM for the Basic Input Output System (BIOS) in our computer motherboard used for initialization of the hardware peripheral. Firmware is also used to define the software code reside in microcontroller and embedded system. Embedded microcontroller is used in various application due to its low cost, small size, reliability, less power consumption and lighter weight. The improvement of technology in term of both hardware and software development had introduce microcontroller like Arduino to allow people to carry out firmware coding relatively ease compared with previously available embedded system. The increased capacity of embedded memory had allowed O/S stack to reside with the embedded system firmware which has blurred the border between firmware and software as how the software code stored in the hardware ROM happened back in 1967. The definition of firmware should be redefined over time to further avoid confusion.

Register allocation may be seen as having two parts: allocation, which decides which values should be in registers, and assignment, which assigns a specific register to each value. Instruction scheduling aims at identifying and moving the instructions in the code, changing their original execution sequence, so that they may run in parallel. Register allocation and instruction scheduling attempt to minimize the execution time of the program, however, they are interdependent and are involved in a prioritization problem. This paper presents a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) related to this problem. From a total of 542 primary studies initially obtained on six databases, 25 studies closely related to this research theme were identified, 12 of them published between 2000 and October 2016. These studies were analyzed to answer the research questions proposed in this SLR, producing useful informations about this theme and about the approaches that, traditionally, have been used to solving this problem. An important finding of this research is the confirmation that this problem still has no definitive solution, and continues to be a relevant challenge for developers, since its solution is closely linked to the quality of the code generated by the compilers in general.</p>","","","10.1145/3125374.3125380","","","code optimization;instruction scheduling;register allocation","","","","","","","","","","","21-22 Sept. 2017","","ACM","ACM Conferences"

Customer preferences, options and experiences can be analyzed through social media, reviews, blogs and other online social networking site data. However, due to increasing informal usage of local languages in social media platforms, multi-lingual or code-mixed data is fast becoming a common occurrence. Mixed code is generated when users use more than a single language in social network comments. Such data presents a significant challenge for applications using sentiment analysis and is yet to be fully explored by researchers. Existing sentiment analysis methods applied to monolingual social data are not suitable for code-mixed data due to the inconsistency in the grammatical structure in these sentences. In this paper, a novel method focused on performing effective sentiment analysis of bilingual sentences written in Hindi and English is proposed, that takes into account linguistic code switching and the grammatical transitions between the two considered languages.

Spinoza provides a wide variety of visualizations and dashboards that allow the instructor to closely monitor the progress of the students in this activity and to pivot to another phase of the activity at the appropriate time. It also has features that allow the instructor to easily detect and intervene with students who have failed to demonstrate mastery of the skills and concepts covered in that lesson. Spinoza builds on the ideas behind several other recent systems and this paper demonstrates that the Solve-Then-Debug approach can successfully keep all students actively engaged in learning coding skills even when there is a large range of skills in the class.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5920-1; POD:978-1-5090-4920-2; USB:978-1-5090-5919-5","10.1109/FIE.2017.8190519","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8190519","","Debugging;Problem-solving;Programming;STEM;Tools","Internet;computer aided instruction;computer science education;program debugging;programming environments;teaching","Computer Supported Agile Teaching methodology;Solve-Then-Debug approach;agile pedagogy;introductory programming classes;spinoza;web-based IDE","","","","","","","","18-21 Oct. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While, web browser plugins disabling and blocking Ads (often associated tracking/analytics scripts), e.g. AdBlock Plus[3] have been well studied and are relatively well understood, an emerging new category of apps in the tracking mobile eco-system, referred as the mobile Ad-Blocking apps, received very little to no attention. With the recent significant increase of the number of mobile Ad-Blockers and the exponential growth of mobile Ad-Blocking apps' popularity, this paper aims to fill in the gap and study this new category of players in the mobile ad/tracking eco-system. This paper presents the first study of Android Ad-Blocking apps (or Ad-Blockers), analysing 97 Ad-Blocking mobile apps extracted from a corpus of more than 1.5 million Android apps on Google Play. While the main (declared) purpose of the apps is to block advertisements and mobile tracking services, our data analysis revealed the paradoxical presence of third-party tracking libraries and permissions to access sensitive resources on users' mobile devices, as well as the existence of embedded malware code within some mobile Ad-Blockers. We also analysed user reviews and found that even though a fraction of users raised concerns about the privacy and the actual performance of the mobile Ad-Blocking apps, most of the apps still attract a relatively high rating.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-1465-5; POD:978-1-5386-1466-2; USB:978-1-5386-1464-8","10.1109/NCA.2017.8171376","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8171376","","Androids;Browsers;Google;Humanoid robots;Libraries;Mobile communication;Tools","Android (operating system);Internet;Web services;Web sites;advertising data processing;data analysis;data privacy;invasive software;mobile computing;online front-ends","AdBlock Plus;Ads disabling;Android Ad-Blocking apps;Google Play;Web browser;Web services;analytics scripts;analytics services;associated tracking;mobile Ad-Blockers;mobile Ad-Blocking apps;mobile apps;mobile tracking services;online adverstisers;third party trackers;third-party tracking libraries;tracking mobile eco-system","","","","","","","","Oct. 30 2017-Nov. 1 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

They can lead to serious safety and security issues. Due to the complicated semantics of C/C++ integers, integer errors are widely harbored in real-world programs and it is error-prone to repair them even for experts. An automatic tool is desired to 1) automatically generate fixes which assist developers to correct the buggy code, and 2) provide sufficient hints to help developers review the generated fixes and better understand integer types in C/C++. In this paper, we present a tool IntPTI that implements the desired functionalities for C programs. IntPTI infers appropriate types for variables and expressions to eliminate representation issues, and then utilizes the derived types with fix patterns codified from the successful human-written patches. IntPTI provides a user-friendly web interface which allows users to review and manage the fixes. We evaluate IntPTI on 7 real-world projects and the results show its competitive repair accuracy and its scalability on large code bases.

Now, after 10 years, the broader CS community has started to adopt Artifact Evaluation (AE) to review artifacts along with papers. In this paper, we examine how AE has incentivized authors, and whether the process is having a measurable impact. Our answer can help guide CS, and more broadly, other computationally-oriented sciences, in encouraging peer-review of software artifacts and developing additional community practices for incentives.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-2686-3; POD:978-1-5386-2687-0","10.1109/eScience.2017.79","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8109184","","Conferences;Electronic mail;Market research;Measurement;Open Access;Robustness;Software","Unified Modeling Language;software engineering","AE;UML;artifact evaluation;computationally-oriented sciences;computer science;data management community;peer-review;real incentive;reevaluating systems;software artifacts;software development","","","","","","","","24-27 Oct. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As developers lack knowledge in applied cryptography and support from experts is scarce, this situation is frequently addressed by adopting static code analysis tools to automatically detect cryptography misuse during coding and reviews, even if the effectiveness of such tools is far from being well understood. This paper proposes a method for benchmarking static code analysis tools for the detection of cryptography misuse, and evaluates the method in a case study, with the goal of selecting the most adequate tools for specific development contexts. Our method classifies cryptography misuse in nine categories recognized by developers (weak cryptography, poor key management, bad randomness, etc.) and provides the workload, metrics and procedure needed for a fair assessment and comparison of tools. We found that all evaluated tools together detected only 35% of cryptography misuses in our tests. Furthermore, none of the evaluated tools detected insecure elliptic curves, weak parameters in key agreement, and most insecure configurations for RSA and ECDSA. This suggests cryptography misuse is underestimated by tool builders. Despite that, we show that it is possible to benefit from an adequate tool selection during the development of cryptographic software.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-0941-5; POD:978-1-5386-0942-2","10.1109/ISSRE.2017.27","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8109084","benchmarking;cryptography;software security;static analysis tools","Benchmark testing;Elliptic curve cryptography;Encoding;Measurement;Software;Tools","cryptography;program diagnostics","ECDSA;RSA;adequate tool selection;critical software vulnerabilities;cryptographic software development;cryptography misuse;static analysis tools;static code analysis tools","","","","","","","","23-26 Oct. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a novel capsule video summarization framework using sparse coding and dictionary learning in feature space. Video frames are clustered into superframes based on power spectral density, and cluster representative frames are used for video summarization. Handcrafted and deep features that are extracted for representative frames are sparse coded using a learned dictionary. Sparse coded features are later used for training SVM classifier.

Various approaches have been proposed to perform feature extraction automatically from different artifacts, for instance, feature location in legacy code. Usually such approaches a) omit variability information and b) rely on artifacts that reside in advanced phases of the development process, thus, being only of limited usefulness in the context of SPLs. In contrast, feature and variability extraction from natural language (NL) documents is more favorable, because a mapping to several other artifacts is usually established from the very beginning. In this paper, we provide a multi-dimensional overview of approaches for feature and variability extraction from NL documents by means of a systematic literature review (SLR). We selected 25 primary studies and carefully evaluated them regarding different aspects such as techniques used, tool support, or accuracy of the results. In a nutshell, our key insights are that i) standard NLP techniques are commonly used, ii) post-processing often includes clustering & machine learning algorithms, iii) only in rare cases, the approaches support variability extraction, iv) tool support, apart from text pre-processing is often not available, and v) many approaches lack a comprehensive evaluation. Based on these observations, we derive future challenges, arguing that more effort need to be invested for making such approaches applicable in practice.</p>","","","10.1145/3106195.3106207","","","Feature Identification;Natural Language Documents;Reverse Engineering;Software Product Lines;Systematic Literature Review;Variability Extraction","","","","","","","","","","","25-29 Sept. 2017","","ACM","ACM Conferences"

However, the recent popularity of practitioner publications indicates a timely moment to reassess the relationships among academic and nonacademic influencers in emerging communication design knowledge. In this paper, we introduce initial findings from the first phase of an ongoing research project that analyzes citation practices in communication design publications. First, we created a sample of over 1500 citations from 30 recent peer-reviewed journal articles that treat emerging communication design themes. Next, we coded authors or author teams from the 30 original articles and the 1500 cited publications to identify whether each author or author team was comprised of academic research faculty, nonacademics, or both. Based on this analysis, we show that academic citations comprise just over 60 percent of the total number in our sample. While this is a clear majority, non-academic citations do frequently influence the shape of peer-reviewed work on emerging communication design themes. Based on our findings, we argue for extending citation analysis to a larger sample of peer-reviewed journal articles and different publications types (i.e., proceedings, books, trade magazines, blogs, social media conversations) in order to test our findings. We furthermore call for social network analysis (SNA) that can reveal more complex interconnections among academic researchers and industry or independent thought leaders around topics such as user experience, content management and strategy, and project management.</p>","","","10.1145/2987592.2987602","","","Citation Analysis;Content Strategy;Empirical Research;Social Networks;User Experience","","","","","","","","","","","23-24 Sept. 2016","","ACM","ACM Conferences"

Nonetheless: i) Developers are not network specialists, while pressure for emphasis on the visible application parts places the network logic out of the coding focus. Moreover, computer networks undergo evolution at paces that developers may not follow. ii) From the network resource provider point of view, marketing novel services and involving a broad audience is also challenge for the same reason. Moreover, the objectives of end-user networking logic are neither clear nor uniform. This constitutes the central optimization of network resources an additional challenge. As a solution to these problems, we propose the Socket Store. The Store is a marketplace containing end-user network logic in modular form. The Store modules act as intelligent mediators between the end-user and the network resources. Each module has a clear, specialized objective, such as connecting two clients over the Internet while avoiding transit networks suspicious for eavesdropping.

However, little empirical evidence exists on the costs and benefits associated with the application of security practices. Balancing the trade off between the costs in time, effort, and complexity of applying security practices and the benefit of an appropriate level of security in delivered software requires measuring security practice benefits and costs. The goal of this research is to support researcher investigations of software development security practice adherence by building and validating a set of security practices and adherence measures through literature review and survey data analysis. We extracted 16 software development security practices from a review of the literature, and established a set of adherence measures based on technology acceptance theory. We built a survey around the 13 most common practices and our adherence measures. We surveyed 11 security-focused open source projects to collect empirical data as a test of our theorizing about practice adherence. In our collected survey data, each of the 13 security practices we identified was used daily by at least one survey participant. Tracking vulnerabilities and applying secure coding standards are the practices most often applied daily. In our data, Ease of use, Effectiveness, and Training, measured via Likert items, did not always show the expected theoretical relationship with practice use. In our data, Training is positively correlated with practice use, while Effectiveness and Ease of use vary in their correlations with practice use on a practice by practice basis.</p>","","","10.1145/3055305.3055312","","","","","","","","","","","","","","4-5 April 2017","","ACM","ACM Conferences"

To address these issues, this paper develops a deep neural network compression framework to reduce the resource usage for efficient visual inference. By reviewing the trained deep model, we propose a hybrid model compression algorithm via four major modules. Approximation module reduces the number of weights in each fully connected layer with low rank approximation. Then, quantization module analyzes weight distribution in each layer and represents them with low precision fixed point, which reduces the bits for storing each weight. After that, pruning module suppresses small weights to further reduce the number of parameters. Finally, coding module joint optimizes the representation and encoding of the sparse structure of the pruned weights with relative index by Huffman coding. Beyond the compression of model size, we propose an adaptive fixed point memory allocation algorithm to reduce memory footprint in inference. The proposed framework, along with the model compression and memory allocation algorithms, can provide 20-30x compression rate with negligible accuracy loss. We conduct an evaluation on two representative models, AlexNet and VGG-16, for object recognition and face verification tasks, which demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed compression framework.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-6067-2; POD:978-1-5090-6068-9; USB:978-1-5090-6066-5","10.1109/ICME.2017.8019465","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8019465","Deep neural networks;face verification;model compression;object recognition;visual inference","Adaptation models;Bandwidth;Computational modeling;Face;Neural networks;Quantization (signal);Visualization","approximation theory;data compression;face recognition;image coding;neural nets;object recognition","AlexNet model;Huffman coding;VGG-16 model;approximation module;coding module;deep neural network compression framework;face verification task;hybrid model compression algorithm;low rank approximation;memory bandwidth;object recognition task;pruning module;quantization module;visual inference","","","","","","","","10-14 July 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Resource limitations often preclude reviewing the entire code base. Making informed decisions on what code to review can improve a team's ability to find and remove vulnerabilities. Risk-based attack surface approximation (RASA) is a technique that uses crash dump stack traces to predict what code may contain exploitable vulnerabilities. The goal of this research is to help software development teams prioritize security efforts by the efficient development of a risk-based attack surface approximation. We explore the use of RASA using Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Windows stack traces from crash dumps. We create RASA at the file level for Firefox, in which the 15.8% of the files that were part of the approximation contained 73.6% of the vulnerabilities seen for the product. We also explore the effect of random sampling of crashes on the approximation, as it may be impractical for organizations to store and process every crash received. We find that 10-fold random sampling of crashes at a rate of 10% resulted in 3% less vulnerabilities identified than using the entire set of stack traces for Mozilla Firefox. Sampling crashes in Windows 8.1 at a rate of 40% resulted in insignificant differences in vulnerability and file coverage as compared to a rate of 100%.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-2717-4; POD:978-1-5386-2718-1","10.1109/ICSE-SEIP.2017.9","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7965451","attack surface;prediction models;stack traces","Computer bugs;Measurement;Security;Software systems","security of data;software engineering","Microsoft Windows;Mozilla Firefox;RASA;proactive security reviews;random sampling;risk-based attack surface approximation;software development lifecycle;test efforts","","","","","","","","20-28 May 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Automating FACS coding would make this research faster and more widely applicable, opening up new avenues to understanding how we communicate through facial expressions. Such an automated process can also potentially increase the reliability, precision and temporal resolution of coding. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of research into machine analysis of facial actions. We systematically review all components of such systems: pre-processing, feature extraction and machine coding of facial actions. In addition, existing FACS-coded facial expression databases are summarised. Finally, challenges that have to be addressed to make automatic facial action analysis applicable in real-life situations are extensively discussed.

Only recent static analysis approaches can resolve reflection under unsound yet pragmatic assumptions. We survey what approaches exist and what their limitations are. We then analyze how real-world Java code uses the Reflection API, and how many Java projects contain code challenging state-of-the-art static analysis. Using a systematic literature review we collected and categorized all known methods of statically approximating reflective Java code. Next to this we constructed a representative corpus of Java systems and collected descriptive statistics of the usage of the Reflection API. We then applied an analysis on the abstract syntax trees of all source code to count code idioms which go beyond the limitation boundaries of static analysis approaches. The resulting data answers the research questions. The corpus, the tool and the results are openly available. We conclude that the need for unsound assumptions to resolve reflection is widely supported. In our corpus, reflection can not be ignored for 78% of the projects. Common challenges for analysis tools such as non-exceptional exceptions, programmatic filtering meta objects, semantics of collections, and dynamic proxies, widely occur in the corpus. For Java software engineers prioritizing on robustness, we list tactics to obtain more easy to analyze reflection code, and for static analysis tool builders we provide a list of opportunities to have significant impact on real Java code.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-3868-2; POD:978-1-5386-3869-9","10.1109/ICSE.2017.53","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7985689","Empirical Study;Java;Reflection;Static Analysis;Systematic Literature Review","Bibliographies;Grammar;Java;Semantics;Software;Systematics;Tools","Java;application program interfaces;computational linguistics;program diagnostics;public domain software;software tools;source code (software);trees (mathematics)","Java Reflection API;Java projects;Java systems;abstract syntax trees;code idioms;collected descriptive statistics;collections semantics;dynamic proxies;literature review;nonexceptional exceptions;programmatic filtering meta objects;real-world Java code analysis;reflection code analysis;reflective Java code;software behavior;source code;static analysis tool","","","","","","","","20-28 May 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

JavaScript is also a dynamically typed language for which static type systems, notably Facebook's Flow and Microsoft's TypeScript, have been written. What benefits do these static type systems provide? Leveraging JavaScript project histories, we select a fixed bug and check out the code just prior to the fix. We manually add type annotations to the buggy code and test whether Flow and TypeScript report an error on the buggy code, thereby possibly prompting a developer to fix the bug before its public release. We then report the proportion of bugs on which these type systems reported an error. Evaluating static type systems against public bugs, which have survived testing and review, is conservative: it understates their effectiveness at detecting bugs during private development, not to mention their other benefits such as facilitating code search/completion and serving as documentation. Despite this uneven playing field, our central finding is that both static type systems find an important percentage of public bugs: both Flow 0.30 and TypeScript 2.0 successfully detect 15%!.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-3868-2; POD:978-1-5386-3869-9","10.1109/ICSE.2017.75","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7985711","Flow;JavaScript;TypeScript;mining software repositories;static type systems","Computer bugs;Documentation;Facebook;History;Measurement uncertainty;Software;Surgery","Java;program debugging","JavaScript;TypeScript;Web domain;bug detection;static type systems","","","","","","","","20-28 May 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Moreover, they do not provide any support for linking user feedback to the source code components to be changed, thus requiring a manual, time-consuming, and error-prone task. In this paper, we introduce CHANGEADVISOR, a novel approach that analyzes the structure, semantics, and sentiments of sentences contained in user reviews to extract useful (user) feedback from maintenance perspectives and recommend to developers changes to software artifacts. It relies on natural language processing and clustering algorithms to group user reviews around similar user needs and suggestions for change. Then, it involves textual based heuristics to determine the code artifacts that need to be maintained according to the recommended software changes. The quantitative and qualitative studies carried out on 44,683 user reviews of 10 open source mobile apps and their original developers showed a high accuracy of CHANGEADVISOR in (i) clustering similar user change requests and (ii) identifying the code components impacted by the suggested changes.

Agile methods provide flexibility towards changes and the emergence of continuous delivery has made regular feedback loops possible. The abilities to maintain high code quality through reviews, to regularly release software, and to collect and prioritize user feedback, are necessary for continuous software engineering (CSE). However, there exists no software process metamodel that handles the continuous character of software engineering. In this paper, we describe an empirical process metamodel for continuous software engineering called CSEPM, which treats development activities as parallel running workflows and allows tailoring and customization. CSEPM includes static aspects that describe the relations between specific CSE concepts including reviews, releases, and feedback. It also describes the dynamic aspect of CSE, how development workflows are activated through change events. We show how CSEPM allows to instantiate linear, iterative, agile and continuous process models and how it enables tailoring and customization.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-0428-1; POD:978-1-5386-0429-8","10.1109/RCoSE.2017.6","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7967945","Agile Methods;Change;Event;Feedback;Process Model;Release;Review;Workflow","Adaptation models;Concrete;Process control;Software;Software engineering;Tools;Unified modeling language","software engineering","CSEPM;continuous software engineering process metamodel;high code quality","","","","","","","","22-22 May 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our results suggest that there is no representative difference between their build success (they are similar in 85% of the analyzed projects), meaning that being a casual contributor is not a strong indicator for creating failing builds.

In this context, we present our initial proposal that consists of an approach to recover PLAs based on the use of (bottom-up) SAR techniques. We performed some studies (such as surveys, literature reviews, and exploratory studies) to investigate the relationship between SAR and PLA to identify gaps and define the research area state-of-the-art. The combination of SAR and PLA is an important strategy to address some issues of PLA design. We identified that few studies address architectural variability, PLA variability traceability, and empirical evaluation such as experiments, surveys, mixed-methods, and so on.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-1589-8; POD:978-1-5386-1590-4","10.1109/ICSE-C.2017.38","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7965394","Product Line Architecture;Software Product Line;Software architecture","Computer architecture;Guidelines;Programmable logic arrays;Proposals;Software architecture;Software product lines;Tools","software architecture;software product lines;source code (software)","PLA design;PLA recovery;PLA variability traceability;SAR techniques;SPL projects;architectural variability;empirical evaluation;product line architecture recovery;software architecture recovery;software product line projects","","","","","","","","20-28 May 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Accordingly, the understanding of social media usage became important. The sentiment analysis is emerged as one of useful methods to analyze emotional stats expressed in textual data including social media data. However, this method still presents some limitations, particularly with an accuracy issue. For example, our previous sentiment analysis used a probability model and needed to adopt human-coded train-sets to maintain an acceptable accuracy level (89%). To overcome and improve this weakness, we propose an automated sentiment analysis in this paper by using the morphological sentence pattern model. We found that this new approach presented in this paper allowed us to achieve a higher level of accuracy (91.2%).

In the past the research community was active in devising change prediction models based on structural metrics extracted from the source code. More recently, Elish et al. showed how evolution metrics can be more efficient for predicting change-prone classes. In this paper, we aim at making a further step ahead by investigating the role of different developer-related factors, which are able to capture the complexity of the development process under different perspectives, in the context of change prediction. We also compared such models with existing change-prediction models based on evolution and code metrics. Our findings reveal the capabilities of developer-based metrics in identifying classes of a software system more likely to be changed in the future. Moreover, we observed interesting complementarities among the experimented prediction models, that may possibly lead to the definition of new combined models exploiting developer-related factors as well as product and evolution metrics.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-0535-6; POD:978-1-5386-0536-3","10.1109/ICPC.2017.19","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7961516","Change prediction;Empirical Studies;Mining Software Repositories","Complexity theory;Context;Maintenance engineering;Measurement;Object oriented modeling;Predictive models;Unified modeling language","preventive maintenance;software maintenance;software metrics;source code (software)","change prediction models;change-prone classes;code metrics;developer-related factors;development process;evolution metrics;preventive maintenance operations;software system;source code;structural metrics","","","","","","","","22-23 May 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To reduce the overall cost of software testing, model-based testing has been widely studied in the past two decades and Finite State Machine (FSM) is used to build the model of software behaviors. However, due to the inadequacy of the modeling ability of FSM, FSM-based testing cannot be taken as a test oracle to solve all issues in software testing. To improve the modeling capability of the model, a few researchers have proposed using Extended Regular Expressions (ERE) to model software behaviors. This paper reviews the method of the ERE-based testing and presents six modeling rules to convert program codes to the ERE model. Then, a case is adopted to illustrate the process of generating executable paths from the ERE model and the method of designing test cases by those paths. Compared with the traditional graphic traversal method of constructing executable paths from the program, ERE not only has robust modeling capability to describe more types of software behaviors than FSM, but also can be used to construct effective executable paths to detect program errors.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5507-4; POD:978-1-5090-5508-1","10.1109/ICIS.2017.7960106","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7960106","ERE-based testing;extended regular expression;model-based testing;software testing","Algorithm design and analysis;Business;Mathematical model;Software;Software testing;Switches","formal languages;program testing","ERE-based testing;cost reduction;executable paths generation;extended regular expression-based testing;model-based testing;program codes;program errors detection;software behaviors;software quality;software testing","","","","","","","","24-26 May 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Mutation analysis has been applied to the studied system under test (60,000 LOC of C code) producing 75,043 mutants of which 27,158 survived test execution. A sample of 200 live mutants has been reviewed by the engineers, who also improved the existing unit test suite based on their findings. <i>Findings:</i> The reviewed sample contained 24+ equivalent mutants and 12+ duplicated mutants. It revealed a weak spot in the testing approach and provided valuable guidance to improve the existing unit test suite. Two new faults were found in the code when improving the tests. Test execution against the mutants required over 4,000 hours computing time.

"The role of anxiety when learning to program: a systematic review of the literature","K. Nolan; S. Bergin","Maynooth University Ireland","Proceedings of the 16th Koli Calling International Conference on Computing Education Research","20170508","2016","","","61","70","<p>The World Health Organisation assert that the number one global health issue for young people is their mental health. For students mental well-being is associated with effective learning and their ability to navigate through college, having the resilience to cope effectively with the challenges and stressors that are a part of everyday student life. The <i>My World Survey</i> , the first of its kind on youth mental health in Ireland, found that for any given 100 students, irrespective of discipline, 40 suffer from depression and 38 from anxiety. In Ireland, Computer Science is only available as a third level course. This means that students often have no prior formal education in Computer Science to build on and so have to learn it for the first time in third level. Computer Science in third level has a high number of contact hours. This is to ensure that the large amount of theoretical and practical work is covered. Alongside the large number of contact hours, there is a considerable need for independent study in order to comprehend the fundamental concepts. The sheer volume of work that novice programmers have to complete is a contributing factor to the students stress. At our institution a large number of Computer Science students register for university counselling services. Learning to program is notoriously difficult with high attrition and failure rates. Learning typically takes place in a lab environment where in-experienced programmers will begin to type (""code"") shortly after being presented with a problem rather than spending time designing a solution. Thus the lab becomes active and busy from the onset, making struggling students cripplingly perceive their peers know more. Further, novice programmers use the compiler to constantly monitor their progress and generating syntax errors can be perceived as negative feedback. Such an environment can create or compound anxiety and stress. Over the past decade, our team has conducted extensive research on le- rning to program and specifically the factors that influence success. In this paper we present a systematic literature review investigating the type of anxiety Computer Science students experience throughout a Computer Science course. The work is novel, valuable, and very timely. The objective of the review is to determine and collate the current state-of-the art on how anxiety affects students when learning to program. The approach used is systematic, in that a structured search of electronic resources has been conducted and the results are presented and quantitatively analysed. A detailed discussion on the findings is provided and important implications and recommendations for the teaching and learning of programming are described.</p>","","Electronic:978-1-4503-4770-9","10.1145/2999541.2999557","","","anxiety;computer science;learning;programming;systematic review","","","","","","","","","","","24-27 Nov. 2016","","ACM","ACM Conferences"

After the code associated with several such functionalities is located in the code, a graphical view allows the developer to assess the source code dependencies between the identified features and with the rest of the system. This helps developers understand the inter-functional interfaces and can be reviewed over time, as features are added and removed, to ensure on-going consistency between the architect's perspective of the features in the system and the code-base.</p>","","","10.1145/2993412.3003390","","","consistency, tool;feature location;feature modeling","","","","","","","","","","","Nov. 28 2016-Dec. 2 2016","","ACM","ACM Conferences"

The feedbacks are valuable to learn various techniques for high quality software development and to support evaluation by the teacher. We also develop various scripts for output checking and Git working status checking. These scripts use exercise contents and student's information in checking and sometimes need to generate typical results from templates for comparing them with the students' answers.

We have devised a set of patterns in code that are typically flagged by consultants as vulnerabilities. The presence of each such pattern is detected by custom developed checkers. A prototype implementation tool called SVAT (Static Vulnerability Analysis Tool) containing custom checkers has been developed by extending the Clang static analysis tool. SVAT is a collection of custom checkers developed to detect the vulnerabilities in TEE.

Geared towards developing such tools, the main goal of this paper is to identify useful computer vision based feature descriptors for recognizing cancerous tissues in histopathologic images. To this end, we use images of Hematoxylin & Eosin-stained microscopic sections of breast and prostate carcinomas, and myometrial leiomyosarcomas, and provide an exhaustive evaluation of several state of the art feature representations for this task. Among the various image descriptors that we chose to compare, including representations based on convolutional neural networks, Fisher vectors, and sparse codes, we found that working with covariance based descriptors shows superior performance on all three types of cancer considered. While covariance descriptors are known to be effective for texture recognition, it is the first time that they are demonstrated to be useful for the proposed task and evaluated against deep learning models. Capitalizing on Region Covariance Descriptors (RCDs), we derive a powerful image descriptor for cancerous tissue recognition termed, Covariance Kernel Descriptor (CKD), which consistently outperformed all the considered image representations. Our experiments show that using CKD lead to 92.83%, 91.51%, and 98.10% classification accuracy for the recognition of breast carcinomas, prostate carcinomas, and myometrial leiomyosarcomas, respectively.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4847-2; POD:978-1-5090-4848-9","10.1109/ICPR.2016.7899848","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7899848","","Cancer;Covariance matrices;Feature extraction;Geometry;Histograms;Image color analysis;Symmetric matrices","cancer;computer vision;feature extraction;image representation;image texture;medical image processing;neural nets;object recognition","CAD;CKD;RCD;breast carcinomas;cancerous tissue recognition;computer vision;computer-aided diagnosis;convolutional neural networks;covariance based descriptors;covariance kernel descriptor;feature descriptors;feature representation;image descriptors;myometrial leiomyosarcomas;pathologists;prostate carcinomas;region covariance descriptors;texture recognition","","","","","","","","4-8 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For example, product reviews are quadruplets of (user, product, keyword, timestamp). How can we analyze such web-scale multi-aspect data? Can we analyze them on an off-the-shelf workstation with limited amount of memory?</p> <p>Tucker decomposition has been widely used for discovering patterns in relationships among entities in multi-aspect data, naturally expressed as high-order tensors. However, existing algorithms for Tucker decomposition have limited scalability, and especially, fail to decompose high-order tensors since they explicitly materialize intermediate data, whose size rapidly grows as the order increases (≥ 4). We call this problem M-Bottleneck (""Materialization Bottleneck"").</p> <p>To avoid M-Bottleneck, we propose S-HOT, a scalable high-order tucker decomposition method that employs the on-the-fly computation to minimize the materialized intermediate data. Moreover, S-HOT is designed for handling disk-resident tensors, too large to fit in memory, without loading them all in memory at once. We provide theoretical analysis on the amount of memory space and the number of scans of data required by S-HOT. In our experiments, S-HOT showed better scalability not only with the order but also with the dimensionality and the rank than baseline methods. In particular, S-HOT decomposed tensors 1000× larger than baseline methods in terms dimensionality. S- HOT also successfully analyzed real-world tensors that are both large-scale and high-order on an off-the-shelf workstation with limited amount of memory, while baseline methods failed. The source code of S-HOT is publicly available at http://dm.postech.ac.kr/shot to encourage reproducibility.</p>","","","10.1145/3018661.3018721","","","","","","","","","","","","","","6-10 Feb. 2017","","ACM","ACM Conferences"

Alternatives to patch-based code contribution tools such as mailing lists and issue trackers have been developed with the pull request systems being the most visible and widely available on GitHub. Is the code contribution process more effective with pull request systems? To answer that, we quantify the effectiveness via the rates contributions are accepted and ignored, via the time until the first response and final resolution and via the numbers of contributions. To control for the latent variables, our study includes a project that migrated from an issue tracker to the GitHub pull request system and a comparison between projects using mailing lists and pull request systems. Our results show pull request systems to be associated with reduced review times and larger numbers of contributions. However, not all the comparisons indicate substantially better accept or ignore rates in pull request systems. These variations may be most simply explained by the differences in contribution practices the projects employ and may be less affected by the type of tool. Our results clarify the importance of understanding the role of tools in effective management of the broad network of potential contributors and may lead to strategies and practices making the code contribution more satisfying and efficient from both contributors' and maintainers' perspectives. </p>","","","10.1145/2950290.2950364","","","Code contribution;FLOSS;effectiveness;issue tracker;mailing list;pull request","","","","","","","","","","","13-18 Nov. 2016","","ACM","ACM Conferences"

In consequence, a wide diversity of solutions has been created based on Web features. Rich Internet Application (RIA) is a relevant term adopted for technological advances in software developed for the Web, which refers to Web applications aimed to provide users with a desktop similar experience. RIAs usually have wider capabilities in comparison with traditional hypertext applications, specially regarding to the interactive elements of their interfaces. New possibilities that have emerged from RIA are essential to support relevant aspects of Web 2.0, such as participation and collaboration. As among other applications, developing accessible and usable RIAs is a valuable and fundamental aspect for development teams, since these new interaction features available on the Web are not always accessible for people with disabilities or reduced mobility. For this reason, this mini-course aims to present the main concepts usually used to evaluate accessibility and usability of RIA; it is an overview of perspectives about practices and theoretical references, from Standards for Quality up to the implementation resources of Web applications. The approach of this mini-course covered practices on main RIA coding techniques, and methods of usability and accessibility evaluation as Guidelines Review and Heuristic Evaluation. Moreover, this mini-course was developed aiming newcomers and professionals that want to specialize their skills on the development and evaluation of usable and accessible RIAs.</p>","","","10.1145/2976796.2988221","","","RIA;accessibility;evaluation;usability","","","","","","","","","","","8-11 Nov. 2016","","ACM","ACM Conferences"

For this purpose, a software-defined radar (SDR) approach has been used, including a digital core with hardware in-the-loop controlled by MATLAB and an analog front end that uses bandpass sampling and a reference channel. The proposed radar setup with processing algorithm has been evaluated in terms of processing time, showing that a real-time implementation on the latest field programmable gate array chipsets is feasible. This approach is flexible and entirely arbitrary waveforms can be generated with an instantaneous bandwidth up to 800 MHz.

They leave executions unverified when they do not check certain properties, fail to verify properties, or check properties under certain unsound assumptions such as the absence of arithmetic overflow. In this paper, we present a technique to complement partial verification results by automatic test case generation. In contrast to existing work, our technique supports the common case that the verification results are based on unsound assumptions. We annotate programs to reflect which executions have been verified, and under which assumptions. These annotations are then used to guide dynamic symbolic execution toward unverified program executions. Our main technical contribution is a code instrumentation that causes dynamic symbolic execution to abort tests that lead to verified executions, to prune parts of the search space, and to prioritize tests that cover more properties that are not fully verified. We have implemented our technique for the .NET static analyzer Clousot and the dynamic symbolic execution tool Pex. It produces smaller test suites (by up to 19.2%), covers more unverified executions (by up to 7.1%), and reduces testing time (by up to 52.4%) compared to combining Clousot and Pex without our technique.","","Electronic:978-1-4503-3900-1; POD:978-1-5090-2071-3","10.1145/2884781.2884843","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7886899","dynamic symbolic execution;partial verification;program verification;static analysis;testing","Aerospace electronics;Conferences;Instruments;Performance analysis;Redundancy;Software engineering;Testing","program testing","Clousot;Pex tool;arithmetic overflow;automatic test case generation;code instrumentation;dynamic symbolic execution;program error detection;program execution;unverified program execution","","","","","","","","14-22 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The advent of software ecosystems like GitHub has enabled something new: the ability to easily switch between projects. Developers also have social incentives to contribute to many projects; prolific contributors gain social recognition and (eventually) economic rewards. Multitasking, however, comes at a cognitive cost: frequent context-switches can lead to distraction, sub-standard work, and even greater stress. In this paper, we gather ecosystem-level data on a group of programmers working on a large collection of projects. We develop models and methods for measuring the rate and breadth of a developers' context-switching behavior, and we study how context-switching affects their productivity. We also survey developers to understand the reasons for and perceptions of multitasking. We find that the most common reason for multitasking is interrelationships and dependencies between projects. Notably, we find that the rate of switching and breadth (number of projects) of a developer's work matter. Developers who work on many projects have higher productivity if they focus on few projects per day. Developers that switch projects too much during the course of a day have lower productivity as they work on more projects overall. Despite these findings, developers perceptions of the benefits of multitasking are varied.","","Electronic:978-1-4503-3900-1; POD:978-1-5090-2071-3","10.1145/2884781.2884875","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7886974","GitHub;Multitasking;productivity","Context;Encoding;Interrupters;Multitasking;Productivity;Software;Switches","project management;software development management","GitHub projects;context-switching behavior;ecosystem-level data gathering;multitasking;software development","","4","","","","","","14-22 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Code changes may affect the security of the application and need to be validated, in order to avoid security vulnerabilities, which is a major undertaking. A statement suffers from privilege protection loss in a release pair when it was definitely protected on all execution paths in the previous release and is now reachable by some execution paths with an inferior privilege protection. Because the code change and the resulting privilege protection loss may be distant (e.g. in different functions or files), developers may find it difficult to diagnose and correct the issue. We use Pattern Traversal Flow Analysis (PTFA) to statically analyze code-derived formal models. Our analysis automatically computes counter-examples of definite protection properties and privilege protection losses. We computed privilege protections and their changes for 147 release pairs of WordPress. We computed counter-examples for a total of 14,116 privilege protection losses we found spread in 31 release pairs.We present the distribution of counter-examples' lengths, as well as their spread across function and file boundaries. Our results show that counter-examples are typically short and localized. The median example spans 88 statements, crosses a single function boundary, and is contained in the same file. The 90<sup>th</sup> centile example measures 174 statements and spans 3 function boundaries over 3 files. We believe that the privilege protection counter-examples' characteristics would be helpful to focus developers' attention for security reviews.

If left unaddressed, these usage-related challenges call into question the legitimacy of zero-day vulnerabilities as enablers of national security and law enforcement operations and erode the benefits that their proportionate use have for the judiciary, defence, and intelligence purposes. This work explores what the private sector involved in the trade of zero-day vulnerabilities can do to ensure the respect human rights and the benign and societally beneficial use of those capabilities.

Despite mobile being a fast growing software sector, code smells in mobile applications have been understudied. We do not know how code smells in mobile applications compare to those in desktop applications, and how code smells are affecting the design of mobile applications. Without such knowledge, application developers, tool builders, and researchers cannot improve the practice and state of the art of mobile development.We first reviewed the literature on code smells in Android applications and found that there is a significant gap between the most studied code smells in literature and most frequently occurring code smells in real world applications. Inspired by this finding, we conducted a large scale empirical study to compare the type, density, and distribution of code smells in mobile vs. desktop applications. We analyze an open-source corpus of 500 Android applications (total of 6.7M LOC) and 750 desktop Java applications (total of 16M LOC), and compare 14,553 instances of code smells in Android applications to 117,557 instances of code smells in desktop applications. We find that, despite mobile applications having different structure and workflow than desktop applications, the variety and density of code smells is similar.

The goal of this study is to identify the current state of art of the existing maintenance effort estimation approaches for OSS. We performed a systematic literature review on the relevant studies published in the period between 2000-2015 by both automatic and manual searches from different sources. We derived a set of keywords from the research questions and established selection criteria to carefully choose the papers to evaluate. 29 out of 3,312 papers were selected based on a well designed selection process. Our results show that the commonly used OSS maintenance effort estimation methods are actual effort estimation and maintenance activity time prediction, the most commonly used metrics and factors for actual effort estimation are source code measurements and people related metrics, the most commonly mentioned activity for maintenance activity time prediction is bug fixing. Accuracy measures and cross validation is used for validating the estimation models. Based on the above findings, we identified the issues in evaluation methods for actual maintenance effort estimations and the needs for quantitative OSS maintenance effort inference from size-related metrics.

Due to the time-consumption of PR review and the diversity of PR aspects, it is becoming a big challenge for core developers to quickly discover the useful PR. Currently, recommending appropriate reviewers (developers) for incoming PR to quickly collect meaningful comments, is treated as an effective and crowdsourced way to help core developers to make decisions and thus accelerate project development. In this paper, we propose a reviewer recommendation approach (EARec) which simultaneously considers developer expertise and authority. Specifically, we first construct a graph of incoming PR and possible reviewers, and then take advantage of text similarity of PR and social relations of reviewers to find the appropriate reviewers.

The subset of robots that has the ability to interact among them and even with people, through gestures or speaking, is known as Social Robots. Model-Driven Development is a promising paradigm because it promotes the reuse of components and quick code generation with quality. ModelDriven Development has been widely used in the context of Robotics in order to reduce complexity, reduce development effort and reuse of software. Due to these facts, it becomes pertinent the development of a systematic literature review to compile these results. In this paper we investigate how MDD techniques have helped the field of Robotics, therefore a systematic literature review was conducted seeking to identify approaches and their main technical features, as well as the types of specific requirements, behavioral and social issues.

Monitors are essential in AS, being responsible for collecting and processing data from environment. There exist different kinds of monitors with distinct characteristics. Based on a literature review, we have noticed that Monitors are usually designed and implemented in an inadequate way: i) making them obscure in the source-code, ii) compelling all of them to have the same polling rate and also iii) predetermining the execution order among them. This leads to maintenance, evolution and performance problems. Besides, based on our observations, this erroneous way monitors are implemented follows a pattern and it is a recurrent practice. Therefore, we believe it can be classified as Monitor Smells of Adaptive Systems. In this paper we present two architectural smells we have identified: the Obscure Monitor and the Oppressed Monitors. The first smell occurs when the monitors are not evident in the source-code. The second smell occurs when monitors are compelled to have the same poling rate and an immutable execution order at runtime. The presence of these smells compromises the reusability, evolvability and maintainability. We have also conducted an exploratory study by comparing the impact of maintenance tasks in the original version of an AS called PhoneAdapter with a refactored version, in which the smells were removed. The results indicate the maintenance is facilitated in the version without the smells.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5086-4; POD:978-1-5090-5087-1","10.1109/SBCARS.2016.19","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7789839","Adaptive System;Architectural Smells;Monitoring","Adaptive systems;Bluetooth;Broadcasting;Global Positioning System;Maintenance engineering;Monitoring;Sensors","software maintenance;software reusability;source code (software)","PhoneAdapter;architectural smells;data collection;data processing;monitor smells of adaptive system characterization;obscure monitor;oppressed monitors;polling rate;software evolvability;software maintenance;software reusability;source-code","","1","","","","","","19-20 Sept. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A comprehensive study of approaches for handling alarms is, however, not found. In this paper, we review 79 alarms handling studies collected through a systematic literature search and classify the approaches proposed into seven categories. The literature search is performed by combining the keywords-based database search and snowballing. Our review is intended to provide an overview of various alarms handling approaches, their merits and shortcomings, and different techniques used in their implementations.

Aligned teams are capable of bringing collaboration and positive results to companies; whereas misalignment among developers can make a conflicted environment and even lead the project to failure. OBJECTIVE. To assist developers in an embedded software development company in their conceptual alignment regarding source code quality. METHOD. In the organizational context, plan and perform a series of studies such as surveys, systematic literature review (SLR), qualitative data analysis and focus group to support the identification of conceptual misalignments among developers and establish common terminology and guidance concerning source code quality. RESULTS. The results from a survey conducted in one company showed a conceptual misalignment among developers regarding the source code quality that was triggering continuous rework during software evolution activities. Through an SLR and a qualitative analysis of code snippets, a set of evidence-based coding guidelines for readability and understandability of source code were formulated. These guidelines were evaluated and used as an instrument for aligning source code perspectives during a focus group, showing their feasibility and adequacy to the company's context. CONCLUSIONS. The use of all contextual information observed -- e.g. teams' locations, software development context, and time constraints -- along with the information gathered during the industry-academia collaboration was particularly important to help us appropriately chose research methods to be used, and formulate evidence-based coding guidelines that matched the company's needs and expectations. Further evaluations have to be carried out to ensure the quality impact of some guidelines proposed before using them all over the company.</p>","","","","","","code quality;conceptual alignment;experimental studies;industry-academia collaboration","","","","","","","","","","","16-24 May 2015","","ACM","ACM Conferences"

To this end, we systematically review the effects of data model changes between platforms. We find that the larger width of integer types and the increased amount of addressable memory introduce previously non-existent vulnerabilities that often lie dormant in program code. We empirically evaluate the prevalence of these flaws on the source code of Debian stable (""Jessie"") and 200 popular open-source projects hosted on GitHub.

We evaluate several techniques to model code relevance, from a naive TOUCH-based approach to generic HISTORY-based classifiers using temporal code metrics at file and method-level granularities, which are then improved by building developer-specific models using TEXT-based features from commit messages.

In this panel, we discuss the current state of blocks-based programming environments, review what we know about learning with blocks-based tools, and look to the future, discussing what form next-generation blocks-based, or blocks-inspired, programming environments might take. Research looking at blocks-based programming is revealing that modality matters: that the representations used to present programming concepts affect learners' conceptual understanding [6], programming practices [3], and perceptions of programming and computer science [5]. This panel brings together leading designers and researchers looking to advance graphical, blocks-based programming through new, innovate designs. The panel will open with a review of current research literature on learning with blocks-based programming and then continue with presentations of three recently designed blocks-based programming environments (Greenfoot 3, GP, Pencil Code), each of which look to push the boundaries of the approach in diffierent directions.

Theisen","North Carolina State University, USA","Proceedings of the 2015 10th Joint Meeting on Foundations of Software Engineering","20161111","2015","","","1063","1065","<p> While software systems are being developed and released to consumers more rapidly than ever, security remains an important issue for developers. Shorter development cycles means less time for these critical security testing and review efforts. The attack surface of a system is the sum of all paths for untrusted data into and out of a system. Code that lies on the attack surface therefore contains code with actual exploitable vulnerabilities. However, identifying code that lies on the attack surface requires the same contested security resources from the secure testing efforts themselves. My research proposes an automated technique to approximate attack surfaces through the analysis of stack traces. We hypothesize that stack traces user crashes represent activity that puts the system under stress, and is therefore indicative of potential security vulnerabilities. The goal of this research is to aid software engineers in prioritizing security efforts by approximating the attack surface of a system via stack trace analysis. In a trial on Mozilla Firefox, the attack surface approximation selected 8.4% of files and contained 72.1% of known vulnerabilities. A similar trial was performed on the Windows 8 product. </p>","","","10.1145/2786805.2807563","","","Stack traces;attack surface;crash dumps","","","","","","","","","","","Aug. 30 2015-Sept. 4 2015","","ACM","ACM Conferences"
"Learning to rank relevant files for bug reports using domain knowledge","X. Ye; R. Bunescu; C. Liu","Ohio University, USA","Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGSOFT International Symposium on Foundations of Software Engineering","20161111","2014","","","689","699","<p> When a new bug report is received, developers usually need to reproduce the bug and perform code reviews to find the cause, a process that can be tedious and time consuming. A tool for ranking all the source files of a project with respect to how likely they are to contain the cause of the bug would enable developers to narrow down their search and potentially could lead to a substantial increase in productivity. This paper introduces an adaptive ranking approach that leverages domain knowledge through functional decompositions of source code files into methods, API descriptions of library components used in the code, the bug-fixing history, and the code change history. Given a bug report, the ranking score of each source file is computed as a weighted combination of an array of features encoding domain knowledge, where the weights are trained automatically on previously solved bug reports using a learning-to-rank technique. We evaluated our system on six large scale open source Java projects, using the before-fix version of the project for every bug report. The experimental results show that the newly introduced learning-to-rank approach significantly outperforms two recent state-of-the-art methods in recommending relevant files for bug reports. In particular, our method makes correct recommendations within the top 10 ranked source files for over 70% of the bug reports in the Eclipse Platform and Tomcat projects. </p>","","","10.1145/2635868.2635874","","","bug reports;learning to rank;software maintenance","","","","","18","","","","","","16-21 Nov. 2014","","ACM","ACM Conferences"
"Milware: Identification and Implications of State Authored Malicious Software","T. Herr; E. Armbrust","The George Washington University","Proceedings of the 2015 New Security Paradigms Workshop","20161111","2015","","","29","43","<p>The pervasive development and deployment of malicious software by states presents a new challenge for the information security and policy communities because of the resource advantage and legal status of governments. The difference between state and non-state authored code is typically described in vague terms of sophistication, contributing to the inaccurate confirmation bias of many that states simply `do it better'. This paper attempts to determine if state authored code is demonstrably different from that written by non-state actors and if so, how. To do so, we examine a collection of malware samples which, through existing analytic techniques, have been attributed to a mix of state and non-state actors. Reviewing technical information available in the public domain for each sample, reverse-engineering a sub-set, we determine that there is a set of criteria by which state authored code can be differentiated from the conventional malware of non-state groups. This MAlicious Software Sophistication or MASS index relies on a set of characteristics which describe the behavior and construction of malware including the severity of exploits and customization of the payload. In addition to highlighting these particular differences, the paper discusses several policy implications which arise from identifying a separate class of state-authored code. This is an interdisciplinary effort and pilot project based on a limited dataset however the conclusions drawn have important ramifications for both the information security and relevant policymaking communities.</p>","","","10.1145/2841113.2841116","","","","","","","","1","","","","","","8-11 Sept. 2015","","ACM","ACM Conferences"

High-integrity app stores must provide stronger guarantees that their apps are not malicious. We propose a verification model for use in such app stores to guarantee that the apps are free of malicious information flows. In our model, the software vendor and the app store auditor collaborate -- each does tasks that are easy for her/him, reducing overall verification cost. The software vendor provides a behavioral specification of information flow (at a finer granularity than used by current app stores) and source code annotated with information-flow type qualifiers. A flow-sensitive, context-sensitive information-flow type system checks the information flow type qualifiers in the source code and proves that only information flows in the specification can occur at run time. The app store auditor uses the vendor-provided source code to manually verify declassifications.</p> <p>We have implemented the information-flow type system for Android apps written in Java, and we evaluated both its effectiveness at detecting information-flow violations and its usability in practice. In an adversarial Red Team evaluation, we analyzed 72 apps (576,000 LOC) for malware. The 57 Trojans among these had been written specifically to defeat a malware analysis such as ours. Nonetheless, our information-flow type system was effective: it detected 96% of malware whose malicious behavior was related to information flow and 82% of all malware. In addition to the adversarial evaluation, we evaluated the practicality of using the collaborative model. The programmer annotation burden is low: 6 annotations per 100 LOC. Every sound analysis requires a human to review potential false alarms, and in our experiments, this took 30 minutes per 1,000 LOC for an auditor unfamiliar with the app.</p>","","","10.1145/2660267.2660343","","","android security;collaborative verification;information flow;static analysis","","","","","14","","","","","","3-7 Nov. 2014","","ACM","ACM Conferences"

Identifying vulnerable code supports decision-making during all phases of software development. An approach for identifying vulnerable code is to identify its <i>attack surface</i>, the sum of all paths for untrusted data into and out of a system. Identifying the code that lies on the attack surface requires expertise and significant manual effort. This paper proposes an automated technique to empirically approximate attack surfaces through the analysis of stack traces. We hypothesize that stack traces from user-initiated crashes have several desirable attributes for measuring attack surfaces. The goal of this research is <i>to aid software engineers in prioritizing security efforts by approximating the attack surface of a system via stack trace analysis.</i> In a trial on Windows 8, the attack surface approximation selected 48.4% of the binaries and contained 94.6% of known vulnerabilities.

Unfortunately, there are cases that independence between statements of code cannot be guaranteed and thus the compiler conservatively produces sequential code. Programs that involve extensive pointer use, irregular access patterns, and loops with unknown number of iterations are examples of such cases. This limits the extraction of parallelism in cases where dependencies are rarely or never triggered at runtime. Speculative parallelism refers to methods employed during program execution that aim to produce a valid parallel execution schedule for programs immune to static parallelization. The motivation for this article is to review recent developments in the area of compiler-driven software speculation for thread-level parallelism and how they came about. The article is divided into two parts. In the first part the fundamentals of speculative parallelization for thread-level parallelism are explained along with a design choice categorization for implementing such systems. Design choices include the ways speculative data is handled, how data dependence violations are detected and resolved, how the correct data are made visible to other threads, or how speculative threads are scheduled. The second part is structured around those design choices providing the advances and trends in the literature with reference to key developments in the area. Although the focus of the article is in software speculative parallelization, a section is dedicated for providing the interested reader with pointers and references for exploring similar topics such as hardware thread-level speculation, transactional memory, and automatic parallelization.</p>","0164-0925;01640925","","10.1145/2821505","","","Thread-level speculation;automatic parallelization;multicore processors;runtime parallelization;speculative parallelization","","","","","","","","","","","January 2016","","ACM","ACM Journals & Magazines"

In this work, we review developments in which complex systems are promoted through: 1) the evolution of teams of programs, and then 2) the context specific reuse of previously evolved code. To do so, two classes of diversity are identified: intra-team diversity and inter-team diversity. Intra-team diversity promotes task decomposition/cooperative coevolution between multiple programs, i.e. teams of programs. A fundamental requirement is that programs can learn context. Inter-team diversity is promoted through maintaining model and task diversity during evolution. The combination of both result in the ability to identify teams of programs and associate them with specific contexts, and then organize teams of programs hierarchically so solve multiple tasks. Finally, the concept of cumulative population wide performance is used to illustrate how inter model diversity in particular introduces useful biases into the types of solutions evolved.</p>","","","10.1145/2908961.2931655","","","coevolution;diversity maintenance;genetic programming;task decomposition","","","","","","","","","","","20-24 July 2016","","ACM","ACM Conferences"

However, their direct application to a large code base is costly and severely impacts program maintainability. While recently introduced domain-specific languages facilitate the application of such transformations, they typically still require manual tuning or auto-tuning techniques to select the transformations that yield optimal performance. In this paper, we introduce MODESTO, a model-driven stencil optimization framework, that for a stencil program suggests program transformations optimized for a given target architecture. Initially, we review and categorize data locality transformations for stencil programs and introduce a stencil algebra that allows the expression and enumeration of different stencil program implementation variants. Combining this algebra with a compile-time performance model, we show how to automatically tune stencil programs. We use our framework to model the STELLA library and optimize kernels used by the COSMO atmospheric model on multi-core and hybrid CPU-GPU architectures. Compared to naive and expert-tuned variants, the automatically tuned kernels attain a 2.0-3.1x and a 1.0-1.8x speedup respectively.</p>","","","10.1145/2751205.2751223","","","fusion;heterogeneous systems;performance model;stencil;tiling","","","","","6","","","","","","8-11 June 2015","","ACM","ACM Conferences"

They provide best practice to handle recurring problems during the software development phase. Three years later, security patterns appeared and provided solutions for security problems. Besides the name analogy, design and security patterns should be very similar except for the security factor. In research and industry software engineering with design patterns is widespread. However, some researchers suspect that security-pattern engineering is made difficult by some issues such as terminology or description form. Detecting adoption problems can help to improve security patterns in future. Thus, they can promote the awareness of security especially in the software maintenance phase where many programmers first give attention to security problems. Therefore, we will compare design and security patterns to find indicators for negative impact on security pattern engineering in software development. We address this issue on inspecting the aspects classification, description form, provided code examples, and usage in the software life-cycle. We determine the degree of maturity of software-security patterns by comparing them to the well-explored design patterns. To achieve the objective, we inspect the pattern terminology and conducted a study on the used description forms including provided UML diagrams and code examples. Moreover, a literature review is conducted to compare their state of research w.r.t. the software life-cycle. The maturity degree of security patterns compared to common design patterns differs and we depict further research opportunities on security patterns.</p>","","","10.1145/2855321.2855364","","","design patterns;patterns;security patterns","","","","","1","","","","","","8-12 July 2015","","ACM","ACM Conferences"

Consider loading a web page (like starting GMAIL) the page is transferred to the client, any JavaScript is compiled, the JavaScript executes, and the page gets displayed. The classic compiler model (which was first developed in the late 50's) was a great fit for single core machines but has fallen behind architecture, and language. For example how do you compile a single program for a machine that has both a CPU and a graphics coprocessor (a GPU) with a very different programming and memory model? Together with the changes in architecture there have been changes in programming languages. Dynamic languages are used more, static languages are used less. How does this effect compiler research? In this talk, I'll review a number of traditional compiler research challenges that have (or will) become burning issues and will describe some new problems areas that were not considered in the past.

In order to control and process cases, the ODAR has established a Case Processing and Management System (CPMS) to record management information since December 2003. The CPMS provides a detailed case status history for each case. Due to the large number of appeal requests and limited resources, the number of pending claims at ODAR was over one million cases by March 31, 2015. Our National Institutes of Health (NIH) team collaborated with SSA and developed a Case Status Change Model (CSCM) project to meet the ODAR's urgent need of reducing backlogs and improve hearings and appeals process. One of the key issues in our CSCM project is to estimate the expected service time and its variation for each case status code. The challenge is that the system's recorded job departure times may not be the true job finished times. As the CPMS timestamps data of case status codes showed apparent batch patterns, we proposed a batch model and applied the constrained least squares method to estimate the mean service times and the variances. We also proposed a batch search algorithm to determine the optimal batch partition, as no batch partition was given in the real data. Simulation studies were conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed methods. Finally, we applied the method to analyze a real CPMS data from ODAR/SSA.</p>","","","10.1145/2939672.2939706","","","batch information matrix;batch model;batched timestamps data;case processing and management system;constrained least squares estimation;disability determining process;service time","","","","","","","","","","","13-17 Aug. 2016","","ACM","ACM Conferences"

A categorized typology of skills was developed which grouped the initial twenty three skills into seven higher order categories. The seven categories of skills were identified as: (1) Prepare data for subject matter expert (SME), analyst or other external party for further analysis; (2) Apply simulation modelling, statistical techniques and provide business insight; (3) Manage stakeholders and project and operational tasks; (4) Develop strategic long term BI roadmap that links to corporate strategy; (5) Understand business processes in order to effectively extract user requirements; (6) Design and code sustainable solutions; (7) Absorb and distribute knowledge.</p>","","","10.1145/2987491.2987521","","","Analytics;Business Intelligence;IS Profession;IT Skills;Typology","","","","","","","","","","","26-28 Sept. 2016","","ACM","ACM Conferences"
"ALETHEIA: Improving the Usability of Static Security Analysis","O. Tripp; S. Guarnieri; M. Pistoia; A. Aravkin","IBM T.J. Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, NY, USA","Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security","20161111","2014","","","762","774","<p>The scale and complexity of modern software systems complicate manual security auditing. Automated analysis tools are gradually becoming a necessity. Specifically, static security analyses carry the promise of efficiently verifying large code bases. Yet, a critical usability barrier, hindering the adoption of static security analysis by developers, is the excess of false reports. Current tools do not offer the user any direct means of customizing or cleansing the report. The user is thus left to review hundreds, if not thousands, of potential warnings, and classify them as either actionable or spurious. This is both burdensome and error prone, leaving developers disenchanted by static security checkers.</p> <p>We address this challenge by introducing a general technique to refine the output of static security checkers. The key idea is to apply statistical learning to the warnings output by the analysis based on user feedback on a small set of warnings. This leads to an interactive solution, whereby the user classifies a small fragment of the issues reported by the analysis, and the learning algorithm then classifies the remaining warnings automatically. An important aspect of our solution is that it is user centric. The user can express different classification policies, ranging from strong bias toward elimination of false warnings to strong bias toward preservation of true warnings, which our filtering system then executes.</p> <p>We have implemented our approach as the Aletheia tool. Our evaluation of Aletheia on a diversified set of nearly 4,000 client-side JavaScript benchmarks, extracted from 675 popular Web sites, is highly encouraging. As an example, based only on 200 classified warnings, and with a policy biased toward preservation of true warnings, Aletheia is able to boost precision by a threefold factor (x 2.868), while reducing recall by a negligible factor (x 1.006). Other policies are enforced with a similarly high level of efficacy.</p>","","","10.1145/2660267.2660339","","","classification;false alarms;information-flow security;machine learning;static analysis;usable security","","","","","1","","","","","","3-7 Nov. 2014","","ACM","ACM Conferences"

These points of so called awareness information are critical for an efficient and smooth collaboration but cannot be obtained via the natural mechanisms in virtual teams. Application sharing and groupware for collaborative editing are widely used for collaborative tasks in distributed software development but considered from the awareness and flexibility aspect they are far off the co-located setting. To better support virtual team collaboration by improving tools for distributed software development it is neccesary to evaluate awareness and its impacts to certain collaborative situations. Awareness itself is an invisible phenomenon and due to its intangible nature cannot be easily observed or measured. Thus we recorded virtual teams using Saros, a groupware for distributed collaborative party programming, respectively VNC and now analyse these videos using the grounded theory methodology. This approach for evaluating awareness leads to various problems concerning the recording setup and time exposure for analysis.</p>","","","","","","CSCW;application sharing;collaborative editing;distributed software development;groupware;workspace awareness","","","","","","","","","","","5-5 June 2012","","ACM","ACM Conferences"

As a result, computing educators have tried a variety of instructional methods to assist beginning programmers. These include developing approaches geared specifically toward novices and experimenting with different introductory programming languages. However, determining the effectiveness of these interventions poses a problem. The research presented here developed an instrument to assess student learning of fundamental and object-oriented programming concepts, then used that instrument to investigate the impact of different teaching approaches and languages on university students’ ability to learn those concepts. Extensive data analysis showed that the instrument performed well overall. Reliability of the assessment tool was statistically satisfactory and content validity was supported by intrinsic characteristics, question response analysis, and expert review. Preliminary support for construct validity was provided through exploratory factor analysis. Three components that at least partly represented the construct “understanding of fundamental programming concepts” were identified: methods and functions, mathematical and logical expressions, and control structures. Analysis revealed significant differences in student performance based on instructional language and approach. The analyses showed differences on the overall score and questions involving assignment, mathematical and logical expressions, and code completion. Instructional language and approach did not appear to affect student performance on questions addressing object-oriented concepts.</p>","","","10.1145/2785807","","","Education","","","","","1","","","","","","February 2016","","ACM","ACM Journals & Magazines"

In GP these impacts are driven by far more than the absolute computational power of the languages used; just because a computation is theoretically possible in a language, it doesn't mean it's readily discoverable or leveraged by evolution. Highly expressive languages can facilitate the evolution of programs for any computable function using, as appropriate, multiple data types, evolved subroutines, evolved control structures, evolved data structures, and evolved modular program and data architectures. In some cases expressive languages can even support the evolution of programs that express methods for their own reproduction and variation (and hence for the evolution of their offspring).</p> <p>This tutorial will present a range of approaches that have been taken for evolving programs in expressive programming languages. We will then provide a detailed introduction to the Push programming language, which was designed specifically for expressiveness in genetic programming systems. Push programs are syntactically unconstrained but can nonetheless make use of multiple data types and express arbitrary control structures, potentially supporting the evolution of complex, modular programs in a particularly simple and flexible way.</p> <p>Interleaved with our description of the Push language will be demonstrations of the use of analytical tools such as graph databases and program diff/merge tools to explore ways in which evolved Push programs are actually taking advantage of the language's expressive features. We will illustrate, for example, the effective use of multiple types and type-appropriate functions, the evolution and modification of code blocks and looping/recursive constructs, and the ability of Push programs to handle multiple, potentially related tasks.</p> <p>We will conclude wi- h a brief review of over a decade of Push-based research, including the production of human-competitive results, along with recent enhancements to Push that are intended to support the evolution of complex and robust software systems.</p>","","","10.1145/2908961.2926988","","","evolvability;genetic programming;push programming language","","","","","","","","","","","20-24 July 2016","","ACM","ACM Conferences"

Here we explore the meaning and potential impact of learning coding/programming for younger students. We collect the arguments for and against learning coding at a young age, and review the initiatives that have been developed to achieve this (including new languages, school curricula, and teaching resources). This leads to a set of criteria around the value of teaching young people to code, to inform curriculum designers, teachers and parents. The age at which coding should be taught can depend on many factors, including the learning tools used, context, teacher training and confidence, culture, specific skills taught, how engaging an ILE is, how much it lets students explore concepts for themselves, and whether opportunities exist to continue learning after an early introduction.</p>","","","10.1145/2670757.2670774","","","coding;programming;young students","","","","","6","","","","","","5-7 Nov. 2014","","ACM","ACM Conferences"

Programs, nowadays often consisting of millions of lines of code, have grown much too large to allow for a complete manual inspection. Nevertheless, security experts need to judge whether an application is trustworthy or not, developers need to find bugs, and quality experts need to assess the maturity of software products. Thus, analysts take advantage of automated data flow analysis tools to find candidates for suspicious leaks which are then further investigated. While much progress has been made in the area with a broad variety of static data flow analysis tools proposed in academia and being offered commercially, the number of false alarms raised by these tools is still a concern. Many of the false alarms are reported because the analysis tool detects data flows along paths which are not realizable at runtime, e.g., due to contradictory conditions on the path. Still, every single report is a potential issue and must be reviewed by an expert which is labor-intensive and costly. In this work, we therefore propose TASMAN, a post-analysis based on symbolic execution that removes such false data leaks along unrealizable paths from the result set. Thus, it greatly improves the usefulness of the result presented to the human analyst. In our experiments on DroidBench examples, TASMAN reduces the number of false positives by about 80% without pruning any true positives. Additionally, TASMAN also identified false positives in real-world examples which we confirmed by hand. With an average execution time of 5.4 seconds per alleged leak to be checked on large real-world applications, TASMAN is fast enough for practical use. </p>","","","10.1145/2771284.2771285","","","Data Flow Analysis;False Positives;Precision;Symbolic Execution;TASMAN","","","","","1","","","","","","14-14 June 2015","","ACM","ACM Conferences"

However, CPGs are tradition-ally paper-based, with only a few CPGs having been computerised for Malawi's national electronic health record system. These CPGs have been hard-coded into the system, necessitating significant additional work to add support for future and revised CPGs. We further investigate CPG computerisation challenges in order to understand the motivations for the current computerised CPGs implementation. We use semi-structured interviews, code reviews, and observations in Malawi. Most significantly, we extend existing understanding of software engineering principles to the context of low-resource environments, noting that the tensions between conflicting stakeholder requirements, deadline and deliverable expectations, and good software engineering often result in systems that are harder to maintain, further exacerbating potential problems with longevity of ICTD deployments.

We will contrast the approaches developed by Glaser and Strauss, and introduce coding theory - the most prominent qualitative method for performing analysis to discover Grounded Theory. Topics include coding frames, first- and second-cycle coding, and saturation. We will use examples from security interview scripts to teach participants: developing a coding frame, coding a source document to discover relationships in the data, developing heuristics to resolve ambiguities between codes, and performing second-cycle coding to discover relationships within categories. Then, participants will learn how to discover theory from coded data. Participants will further learn about inter-rater reliability statistics, including Cohen's and Fleiss' Kappa, Krippendorf's Alpha, and Vanbelle's Index.

Therefore, we use data mining to extract feature information, which we then combine with more readily available information to analyse apps' technical, customer and business aspects. We applied our approach to the 32,108 non-zero priced apps available in the Blackberry app store in September 2011. Our results show that there is a strong correlation between customer rating and the rank of app downloads, though perhaps surprisingly, there is no correlation between price and downloads, nor between price and rating. More importantly, we show that these correlation findings carry over to (and are even occasionally enhanced within) the space of data mined app features, providing evidence that our 'App store MSR' approach can be valuable to app developers.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2-3 June 2012","","ACM","ACM Conferences"

Epistemic actions are frequently presented as a beneficial consequence of interacting with tangible systems. However, we currently lack tools to measure epistemic behaviors, making substantiating such claims highly challenging. This paper addresses this problem by presenting ATB, a video-coding framework that enables the identification and measurement of different epistemic actions during problem-solving tasks. The framework was developed through a systematic literature review of 78 papers, and analyzed through a study involving a jigsaw puzzle -- a classical spatial problem -- involving 60 participants. In order to assess the framework's value as a metric, we analyze the study with respect to its reliability, validity and predictive power. The broadly supportive results lead us to conclude that the ATB framework enables the use of observed epistemic behaviors as a performance metric for tangible systems. We believe that the development of metrics focused explicitly on the properties of tangible interaction are currently required to gain insight into the genuine and unique benefits of tangible interaction. The ATB framework is a step towards this goal.</p>","","","10.1145/2677199.2680546","","","epistemic actions;tangible interaction;video-coding","","","","","","","","","","","15-19 Jan. 2015","","ACM","ACM Conferences"

Producing accurate segmentations often proves to be both inefficient and challenging, in part due to lack of imaging data quality (contrast and resolution), and because of ambiguity in the data that can only be resolved with higher-level knowledge of the structure and the context wherein it resides. Automatic and semi-automatic approaches are improving, but in many cases still fail or require substantial manual clean-up or intervention. Expert manual segmentation and review is therefore still the gold standard for many applications. Unfortunately, existing tools (both custom-made and commercial) are often designed based on the underlying algorithm, not the best method for expressing higher-level intention. Our goal is to analyze manual (or semi-automatic) segmentation to gain a better understanding of both low-level (perceptual tasks and actions) and high-level decision making. This can be used to produce segmentation tools that are more accurate, efficient, and easier to use. Questioning or observation alone is insufficient to capture this information, so we utilize a hybrid capture protocol that blends observation, surveys, and eye tracking. We then developed, and validated, data coding schemes capable of discerning low-level actions and overall task structures.</p>","","","10.1145/2968220.2968235","","","3D volume segmentation;conceptual framework","","","","","","","","","","","24-26 Sept. 2016","","ACM","ACM Conferences"

They are not just subjective mental constructs, but are objective features of a system's design: increments of functionality that were consciously introduced by a designer to serve particular purposes. This essay argues for viewing the design of software in terms of concepts, with their invention (or adoption) and refinement as the central activity of software design. A family of products can be characterized by arranging concepts in a dependence graph from which coherent concept subsets can be extracted. Just as bugs can be found in the code of a function prior to testing by reviewing the programmer's argument for its correctness, so flaws can be found in a software design by reviewing an argument by the designer. This argument consists of providing, for each concept, a single compelling purpose, and demonstrating how the concept fulfills the purpose with an archetypal scenario called an 'operational principle'. Some simple conditions (primarily in the relationship between concepts and their purposes) can then be applied to reveal flaws in the conceptual design. </p>","","Electronic:978-1-4503-3688-8","10.1145/2814228.2814248","","","Concepts;conceptual design;purposes;usability","","","","","","","","","","","25-30 Oct. 2015","","ACM","ACM Conferences"

It is therefore important for graduates to have experienced teamwork before they enter the job market.</p> <p>We describe an experiential learning exercise that we designed to teach the software engineering process in conjunction with teamwork skills. The underlying teaching strategy applied in the exercise maximises risks in order to provide maximal experiential learning opportunities. The students are expected to work in fairly large, yet short-lived, instructor-assigned teams to complete software engineering tasks. After undergoing the exercise our students form self-selected teams for their capstone projects. In this article, we determine and report on the influence the teaching exercise had on the formation of teams for the capstone project. By analysing data provided by the students through regular peer reviews we gain insight into the team dynamics as well as to what extent the members contributed to the team effort.</p> <p>We develop and present a graphical model of a capstone project team which highlights participation of individuals during the teaching exercise. The participatory history of the members is visualised using segmented concentric rings. We consider how this visualisation can aid the identification of capstone project teams that are at risk. In our experience the composition of the team and the behaviour of other members in the team may have a marked impact on the behaviour of each individual in the team. We established a team classification in order to model information about teams. We use a statistical clustering method to classify teams. For this we use team profiles that are based on the participatory levels of its members. The team types that emerge from the clustering are used to derive migration models. When we consider migration, we build spring models to visualise the teams through which individuals migrate. We colour code the teams to character- se them according to the team types that were identified during the cluster classification of the teams. Owing to the complexity of the resulting model, only migrations for capstone team members who have worked together during the exercise or for solitary capstone team members are modelled. These models support the identification of areas of interest that warrant further investigation.</p> <p>To conclude, we present our observations from the analysis of team compositions, team types, and team migrations and provide directions for future work and collaborations.</p>","","","10.1145/2791396","","","Software engineering;soft skills;teaching teamwork;team formation;team management","","","","","","","","","","","March 2016","","ACM","ACM Journals & Magazines"

There is currently no existing capability for these to communicate UW with each other unless they carry matching equipment from the same manufacturer. There also are no existing means to discover other communicating assets to permit the formation of ad-hoc networks.

Out goes ICT and how to use Microsoft Office; in comes coding and computer science. Assessment has a crucial role to play in this revolution. If teachers use low-quality assessment instruments we will end-up teaching the wrong subject; and viceversa. This paper reviews the state of the field, and makes concrete, achievable proposals for developing shared, high quality assessments for computer science. Central to this proposal is the collaborative platform VIVA (the Vilnius collaboratively coded and Validated computer science questions/tasks for Assess- ment). Two requirements are key to VIVA: 1) support for multiple competency frameworks, so that the contributors can meta-tag resources with respect to the framework they are most familiar with; and 2) support for crowdsourcing the validation of each question/task and its mapping to competencies. The use of a taxonomy of questions/tasks type that has been mapped to computational thinking concepts and to a competency framework is proposed. Some seed questions are already available in the online platform prototype, and various supporters have granted permission to use large questions banks. The design requirements of a full implementation of the VIVA platform for a modern and effective approach to assessment including support for digital badges, are outlined; and some preliminary results from a survey administered to the initial contributors to VIVA are presented.</p>","","","10.1145/2858796.2858801","","","activities;assessment;competency frameworks;computational thinking;crowdsourcing;learning progression;lifelong learning;metadata;open badges;questions;repositories","","","","","1","","","","","","4-8 July 2015","","ACM","ACM Conferences"

This paper describes the development of the WEarable Acceptability Range (WEAR Scale), designed to predict acceptance of a particular wearable. First, the construct ""social acceptability of a wearable"" was defined using literature and an interview study. Second, the WEAR Scale's item pool was composed, and reviewed by experts.

This situation poses a serious difficulty in developing efficient parallel programs. We often need to manually transform codes written in usual programming patterns to ones in a parallelizable form. We hope to have a solid foundation to streamline this transformation. This talk first reviews necessity of a method of systematically deriving parallelizable codes and then introduces an ongoing work on extending lambda calculus for the purpose. The distinguished feature of the new calculus is a special construct that enable evaluation with incomplete information, which is useful to express important parallel computation patterns such as reductions (aggregations).

Currently, many individuals and organizations mitigate the burden of local data storage and reduce the maintenance cost by outsourcing data to the cloud. However, the outsourced data is not always trustworthy due to the loss of physical control and possession over the data. As a result, many scholars have concentrated on relieving the security threats of the outsourced data by designing the Remote Data Auditing (RDA) technique as a new concept to enable public auditability for the stored data in the cloud. The RDA is a useful technique to check the reliability and integrity of data outsourced to a single or distributed servers. This is because all of the RDA techniques for single cloud servers are unable to support data recovery; such techniques are complemented with redundant storage mechanisms. The article also reviews techniques of remote data auditing more comprehensively in the domain of the distributed clouds in conjunction with the presentation of classifying ongoing developments within this specified area. The thematic taxonomy of the distributed storage auditing is presented based on significant parameters, such as scheme nature, security pattern, objective functions, auditing mode, update mode, cryptography model, and dynamic data structure. The more recent remote auditing approaches, which have not gained considerable attention in distributed cloud environments, are also critically analyzed and further categorized into three different classes, namely, replication based, erasure coding based, and network coding based, to present a taxonomy. This survey also aims to investigate similarities and differences of such a framework on the basis of the thematic taxonomy to diagnose significant and explore major outstanding issues.</p>","0360-0300;03600300","","10.1145/2764465","","","Remote data auditing;cloud computing;erasure coding;network coding;replication","","","","","6","1","","","","","July 2015","","ACM","ACM Journals & Magazines"

Payer","Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN","IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","20170811","2017","43","8","701","714","Existing static analysis tools require significant programmer effort. On large code bases, static analysis tools produce thousands of warnings. It is unrealistic to expect users to review such a massive list and to manually make changes for each warning. To address this issue we propose CCBot (short for CodeContracts Bot), a new tool that applies the results of static analysis to existing code through automatic code transformation. Specifically, CCBot instruments the code with method preconditions, postconditions, and object invariants which detect faults at runtime or statically using a static contract checker. The only configuration the programmer needs to perform is to give CCBot the file paths to code she wants instrumented. This allows the programmer to adopt contract-based static analysis with little effort. CCBot's instrumented version of the code is guaranteed to compile if the original code did. This guarantee means the programmer can deploy or test the instrumented code immediately without additional manual effort. The inserted contracts can detect common errors such as null pointer dereferences and out-of-bounds array accesses. CCBot is a robust large-scale tool with an open-source C# implementation. We have tested it on real world projects with tens of thousands of lines of code. We discuss several projects as case studies, highlighting undiscovered bugs found by CCBot, including 22 new contracts that were accepted by the project authors.","0098-5589;00985589","","10.1109/TSE.2016.2625248","10.13039/100000001 - NSF; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7736073","Contract-based verification;assertions;automated patching;class invariants","C# languages;Computer bugs;Contracts;Instruments;Reactive power;Runtime;Semantics","C# language;program compilers;program diagnostics;program verification;software fault tolerance","CCBot;CodeContracts Bot;automatic code transformation;automatic contract insertion;contract-based static analysis;contract-based verification;fault detection;file paths;null pointer dereferences;object invariants;open-source C# implementation;out-of-bounds array accesses;static analysis tools;static contract checker","","","","","","","20161104","Aug. 1 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

So, researchers investigated how architects at Ericsson were organized, their roles and responsibilities, and the effort they spent guarding and governing a large-scale legacy product developed by teams at multiple locations. Despite recent trends such as microservices and agile development, Ericsson had to follow a more centralized approach to deal with the challenges of scale, distribution, and monolithic architecture of a legacy software product. So, the architectural decisions were centralized to a team of architects. The team extensively used code reviews to not only check the code's state but also reveal defects that could turn into maintainability problems. The study results also suggest that the effort architects spend designing architecture, guarding its integrity and evolvability, and mentoring development teams is directly related to team maturity.

Our approach finds a good balance between minimizing the number of recommended classes and maximizing the relevance of the proposed solution using a multi-objective optimization algorithm. The relevance of the recommended classes (solution) is estimated based on the use of the history of changes and bug-fixing, and the lexical similarity between the bug report description and the API documentation. We evaluated our system on 6 open source Java projects, using the version of the project before fixing the bug of many bug reports. The experimental results show that the search-based approach significantly outperforms three state-of-the-art methods in recommending relevant files for bug reports.

"An Overview of Physical Layer Security in Wireless Communication Systems With CSIT Uncertainty","A. Hyadi; Z. Rezki; M. S.

This is established through appropriately designed coding techniques and signal processing strategies. In this vein, it has been shown that fading channels can enhance the transmission of confidential information and that a secure communication can be achieved even when the channel to the eavesdropper is better than the main channel. However, to fully benefit from what fading has to offer, the knowledge of the channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) is of primordial importance. In practical wireless communication systems, CSIT is usually obtained, prior to data transmission, through CSI feedback sent by the receivers. The channel links over which this feedback information is sent can be either noisy, rate-limited, or delayed, leading to CSIT uncertainty. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of recent and ongoing research works on physical layer security with CSIT uncertainty. We focus on both information theoretic and signal processing approaches to the topic when the uncertainty concerns the channel to the wiretapper or the channel to the legitimate receiver. Moreover, we present a classification of the research works based on the considered channel uncertainty. Mainly, we distinguish between the cases when the uncertainty comes from an estimation error of the CSIT, from a CSI feedback link with limited capacity, or from an outdated CSI.","","","10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2612585","10.13039/501100004052 - CRG 2 Grant from the Office of Sponsored Research at the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7572890","Physical layer security;channel state information;estimation error;fading channels;outdated CSI;rate-limited feedback","Channel state information;Error analysis;Fading channels;Feedback;Network security;Physical layer;Receivers;Uncertainty","data communication;fading channels;radio links;radio receivers;radio transmitters;signal processing;telecommunication security","CSI feedback link;CSIT uncertainty;channel imperfections;channel state information at the transmitter;channel uncertainty;confidential information transmission;data transmission;fading channels;information theoretic approach;physical layer security;receivers;secure communication;signal processing strategies;wireless communication systems;wiretapper","","3","","","","","20160921","2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Addressing potential errors in the development phase is error-prone even for experts and essentially hinders developing efficiency. In this paper we propose a novel approach to automate fix for C integer errors. Our approach directly replaces original C integers with dynamic-precision integers to fix potential errors without detecting them in advance. Many errors can be fixed by precision improvement without changing the design of application. We implement a tool CIntFix to automatically fix C integer errors. CIntFix succeeds in fixing all 5414 programs in NIST's Juliet test suite from 7 weakness categories. Meanwhile, on Juliet test suite and SPEC CINT2000 benchmarks, CIntFix processes C source code at the rate of 0.157s/KLOC and the fixed programs have 18.0% slowdown on average.

Effective risk management is, therefore, vital for a successful project outcome. Design Rule Spaces (DRSpaces) have been used by other researchers to understand why implemented software is error-prone [1, 2]. This industrial case study evaluates whether such spaces are durable, meaningful, and isolating risk containers. DRSpaces were created from UML class diagrams of architectural design artefacts. In our study, object orientated metrics were calculated from the UML diagrams, and compared to the error-proneness of the DRSpace implementation, to determine whether architectural coupling translated into implementation difficulties. A correlation between architectural coupling and error-proneness of DRSpaces was observed in the case study. Software developers were asked to identify DRSpaces they found difficult to implement, in order to understand which factors, other than architectural coupling, were also important. The qualitative results show agreement between the code areas developers found difficult to implement and the error-prone DRSpaces. However, the results also show that architectural coupling is just one risk factor of many. The case study suggests that architectural DRSpaces can be used to facilitate a targeted risk review prior to implementation and manage risk.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-2131-4; POD:978-1-5090-2563-3","10.1109/WICSA.2016.34","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7516850","analysis;architecture;risk;software","Computer architecture;Computer bugs;Containers;Couplings;Measurement;Software;Unified modeling language","Unified Modeling Language;object-oriented methods;project management;risk management;software architecture;software development management","DRSpace implementation;UML class diagrams;UML diagrams;architectural DRSpaces;architectural coupling;architectural design artefacts;design rule space evaluation;industrial projects;object orientated metrics;risk container isolation;risk containers;risk management;software development","","1","","","","","","5-8 April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The realization of the JET T-T and D-T experimental campaigns is an important contribution to fill major physics and technological gaps for the development of fusion energy. The JET-ITER-like wall experiment provides an ideal test bed to study in an integrated way the interplay between the plasma surface interactions and the plasma operation with the ITER plasma-facing materials (beryllium wall and tungsten divertor). Recent and significant progresses of the ITER scenarios development on JET are reviewed together with their extrapolation by assuming a 50%-50% D-T plasma mixture. The JET performance has been recovered at a plasma current up to 2.5 MA for both the ITER baseline and the hybrid scenarios. These two scenarios will be pursued at higher fusion performance by increasing the applied powers and/or plasma current in the coming experimental campaign in the conditions compatible with the W-divertor. The D-T experimental campaign will provide a unique opportunity to benchmark the ITER relevant 14-MeV neutron detection calibration procedures, neutronic codes for calculating the neutron flux, and machine activation, and to investigate the radiation damage of ITER functional materials. In view of the full tritium and D-T experimental campaigns, the JET tritium plant is being upgraded with an increase in the T-fuelling capability using different gas injection modules, with an improved T-accountancy and a new water detritiation system to fully close the T-cycle at JET.","0093-3813;00933813","","10.1109/TPS.2016.2572158","EUROfusion Consortium and has received funding from the Euratom Research and Training Programme 2014-2018; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7506213","Fusion energy;ITER plasma scenarios;neutronics;tokamak;tritium technology","Europe;Heating;Impurities;Neutrons;Physics;Plasma temperature","Tokamak devices;fusion reactor divertors;plasma boundary layers;plasma toroidal confinement","European program;ITER baseline;ITER functional materials;ITER plasma-facing materials;ITER scenarios development;JET D-T experimental campaign;JET T-T experimental campaign;JET program;JET-ITER-like wall experiment;Joint European Torus;W-divertor;extended deuterium-tritium experimental campaign;fusion energy;neutron detection calibration procedures;neutron flux;neutronic codes;plasma operation;plasma surface interactions;pure tritium experimental campaign;radiation damage;water detritiation system","","2","","","","","20160707","Sept. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

At these frequencies, phased arrays are used to meet link budgets by combining phase-adjusted responses of multiple antennas to form a high-gain, directive beam which is electrically steerable. Current requirements point to array sizes ranging from 8-32 elements, each of which must be measured and calibrated in terms of RF output power and phase to obtain the desired array performance. This paper will first review phased-array topologies and calibration requirements. We will then present a code modulated technique for manufacturing test of the array which uses only digital code modulators per element and a single global mm-wave squaring circuit in the form of a power detector. This approach allows measurement of full array performance with a single detector using minimum additional built-in-test hardware. Behavioral models indicate that this method can estimate the phase response within 1 degree and an output power within 0.2 dB for each individual element using global array measurements.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8454-4; POD:978-1-4673-8455-1; USB:978-1-4673-8453-7","10.1109/VTS.2016.7477274","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7477274","","Calibration;Multiaccess communication;Phase measurement;Phase shifters;Phased arrays;Power generation","antenna phased arrays;built-in self test;calibration;detector circuits;millimetre wave antenna arrays;modulation coding;radiocommunication;telecommunication industry","RF output power;behavioral models;built-in-test hardware;code modulated technique;code-modulated embedded test;digital code modulators;directive beam;global array measurements;link budgets;manufacturing test;millimeter wave design;mm-wave design;mm-wave squaring circuit;phase response;phase-adjusted responses;phased-array topologies;power detector;wireless communications","","","","8","","","","25-27 April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most of these models focus exclusively on source code properties, like the number of added or deleted lines, or developer-related measures like experience. However, a code change is only the outcome of a much longer process, involving discussions on an issue report and review discussions on (different versions of) a patch. % Ignoring the characteristics of these activities during prediction is unfortunate, since Similar to how body language implicitly can reveal a person's real feelings, the length, intensity or positivity of these discussions can provide important additional clues about how risky a particular patch is or how confident developers and reviewers are about the patch. In this paper, we build logistic regression models to study the impact of the characteristics of issue and review discussions on the defect-proneness of a patch. Comparison of these models to conventional source code-based models shows that issue and review metrics combined improve precision and recall of the explanatory models up to 10%. Review time and issue discussion lag are amongst the most important metrics, having a positive (i.e., increasing) relation with defect-proneness.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1855-0; POD:978-1-5090-1856-7","10.1109/SANER.2016.113","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7476642","Human Discussion Metrics;Just-In-Time Quality Assurance","Biological system modeling;Control systems;Data models;Databases;Measurement;Predictive models;Software","configuration management;just-in-time;project management;quality assurance;regression analysis;software fault tolerance;software quality;software reviews;source code (software)","Eclipse;OpenStack;defect prediction models;defect-introducing code changes;defect-proneness;developer-related measures;human discussions;issue discussion lag;just-in-time quality assurance;logistic regression models;person real feelings;precision;project version control system;recall;review metrics;review time;source code properties;source code-based models","","1","","45","","","","14-18 March 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This technique, called Speculative Trace Optimization (STO), enumerates, optimizes, and speculatively executes traces of hot loops. It requires hardware support that can be provided in a similar fashion as that available in Hardware Transactional Memory (HTM) systems. This paper discusses the necessary features to support STO, namely multi-versioning, lazy conflict resolution, eager conflict detection, and transaction synchronization. A review of existing HTM architectures - Intel TSX, IBM BG/Q, and IBM POWER8 - shows that none of them have all the features required to implement STO. However, this work demonstrates that STO can be implemented on top of existing HTM architectures through the addition of privatization and pause/resume code. The evaluation of a prototype STO implementation, on top of Intel TSX, using benchmarks from Parboil, Media Bench, and SPEC2006, indicates that STO can yield whole-program speedups of up to 9%. This initial result is promising given that the prototype has significant overhead caused by the code that compensates for TSX absent features. An analysis, included in the paper, suggests that HTM mechanisms have the potential to considerably improve trace performance provided that they efficiently implement the suggested features.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8621-0; POD:978-1-4673-8622-7","10.1109/SBAC-PADW.2015.13","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7423112","Hardware Transactional Memory;Speculative Execution;Speculative Optimization;TSX;Trace Optimization","Benchmark testing;Computer architecture;Electronic mail;Hardware;Optimization;Privatization;Prototypes","parallel programming;privatisation;synchronisation;transaction processing","HTM architectures;HTM mechanisms;HTM systems;IBM BG/Q;IBM POWER8;Intel TSX;MediaBench;Parboil;SPEC2006;eager conflict detection;hardware support;hardware transactional memory;hardware transactional memory systems;hot code regions;lazy conflict resolution;multiversioning;pause-resume code;privatization;prototype STO implementation;speculation technique;speculative trace optimization;transaction synchronization","","","","13","","","","18-21 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we show ways how to successfully apply the turbo principle to the domain of ASR and thereby provide solutions to the abovementioned information fusion problem. The contribution of our work is fourfold: First, we review the turbo decoding forward-backward algorithm (FBA), giving detailed insights into turbo ASR, and providing a new interpretation and formulation of the so-called extrinsic information being passed between the recognizers. Second, we present a real-time capable turbo-decoding Viterbi algorithm suitable for practical information fusion and recognition tasks. Then we present simulation results for a multimodal example of information fusion. Finally, we prove the suitability of both our turbo FBA and turbo Viterbi algorithm also for a single-channel multimodel recognition task obtained by using two acoustic feature extraction methods. On a small vocabulary task (challenging, since spelling is included), our proposed turbo ASR approach outperforms even the best reference system on average over all SNR conditions and investigated noise types by a relative word error rate (WER) reduction of 22.4% (audio-visual task) and 18.2% (audio-only task), respectively.","2329-9290;23299290","","10.1109/TASLP.2016.2520364","5th International Workshop on Spoken Dialog Systems; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7406701","Speech recognition;hidden Markov models;iterative decoding;multimedia systems;robustness","Acoustics;Convolutional codes;Decoding;Digital communication;Hidden Markov models;Iterative decoding;Speech","Viterbi decoding;audio-visual systems;feature extraction;speech recognition;turbo codes","SNR conditions;acoustic feature extraction method;audio-only task relative WER reduction;audio-visual task relative word error rate reduction;digital communication;groundbreaking innovation;information fusion problem;information recognition;information sources;single-channel multimodel recognition task;small vocabulary task;striking parallels;turbo ASR system performance;turbo automatic speech recognition performance;turbo codes;turbo decoding FBA;turbo decoding forward-backward algorithm;turbo principle;turbo-decoding Viterbi algorithm","","","","64","","","20160212","May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

There is a universal need present for all dynamic web applications and this universal need is the need to store, retrieve or manipulate information from a database. Most of systems which manage the databases and its requirements such as MySQL Server and PostgreSQL use SQL as their language. Flexibility of SQL makes it a powerful language.

However the vast use of SQL based databases has made it the center of attention of hackers. They take advantage of the poorly coded Web applications to attack the databases. They introduce an apparent SQL query, through an unauthorized user input, into the legitimate query statement.

These slow tasks frequently result in situations where most of the time is spent reimplementing old rather than writing new code.</p> <p>The goal of our research is to find programming techniques that increase productivity, maintain high performance, and provide abstraction to free the programmer from these unnecessary and time-consuming tasks. However, such techniques usually come at the cost of substantial performance degradation. This paper investigates current approaches to portable accelerator programming, seeking to answer whether they make it possible to combine high efficiency with sufficient algorithm abstraction. It discusses OpenCL as a potential solution and presents three approaches of writing portable code: GPU-centric, CPU-centric, and combined. By applying the three approaches to a real-world program, we show that it is at least sometimes possible to run exactly the same code on many different devices with minimal performance degradation using parameterization. The main contributions of this paper are an extensive review of the current state-of-the-art and our original approach of addressing the stated problem with the <i>copious-parallelism</i> technique.</p>","","","10.1145/2554850.2555029","","","","","","","","1","","","","","","24-28 March 2014","","ACM","ACM Conferences"

"The Prickly Pear Archive: a portable hypermedia for scholarly publication","","","Proceedings of the 1st Conference of the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment","20160129","2012","","","1","8","<p>An <i>executable paper</i> is a hypermedia for publishing, reviewing, and reading scholarly papers which include a complete HPC software development or scientific code. A <i>hypermedia</i> is an integrated interface to multimedia including text, figures, video, and executables, on a subject of interest. Results within the executable paper include numeric output, graphs, charts, tables, equations and the underlying codes which generated such results. These results are dynamically regenerated and included in the paper upon recompilation and re-execution of the code. This enables a scientifically enriched environment which functions not only as a journal but as a laboratory in itself, in which readers and reviewers may interact with and validate the results.</p> <p>The Prickly Pear Archive (PPA) is such a system [2]. One distinguishing feature of the PPA is the inclusion of an underlying component-based simulation framework, Cactus [8], which simplifies the process of composing, compiling, and executing simulation codes. Code creation is simplified using common bits of infrastructure; each paper augments to the functionality of the framework. New distinguishing features include the (1) portability and (2) reproducibility of the archive, which allow researchers to move and re-create the software environment in which the simulation code was created. Further, the (3) Piraha parser is now used to match complex multi-line expressions inside parameter and LaTEX files. Finally, (4) an altogether new web interface has been created. The new interface options closely mirror the directory structure within the paper itself, which gives the reader a transparent view of the paper. Thus, once accustomed to reading from the archive, assembling a paper package becomes a straightforward and intuitive process.</p> <p>A PPA production system hosted on HPC resources (e.g. an XSEDE machine) unifies the computational scientific process with the publication process. A researcher may use t- e production archive to test simulations; and upon arriving at a scientifically meaningful result, the user may then incorporate the result in an executable paper on the very same resource the simulation was conducted. Housed within a virtual machine, the PPA allows multiple accounts within the same production archive, enabling users across campuses to bridge their efforts in developing scientific codes.</p>","","","10.1145/2335755.2335840","","","","","","","","","","","","","","16-20 July 2012","","ACM","ACM Conferences"

Moreover, with their traditional emphasis on individual problem-solving and skeptical stance toward student collaboration, these degree programs may not be adequately preparing students for careers in the computing profession, in which ""soft skills"" such as collaboration, teamwork, and communication are becoming increasingly important. How can computing educators respond to this state of affairs? One intriguing possibility is to adapt the studio-based learning (SBL) model--the centerpiece of architecture and fine arts education for over a century--for computing education. Rooted in social constructivist learning theory, the SBL model consists of two key components: the design studio, a shared physical space in which students work on solutions to assigned problems; and design crits, in which students present their evolving solutions to peers and experts for critical review. Over the past decade, my colleagues and I have been empirically exploring adaptations of SBL design crits in computing education. In this talk, I will begin by presenting two strands of this work: (a) pedagogical code reviews--an adaptation of the code inspection commonly used in the software industry; and (b) the use of prototype walkthroughs--a pedagogical version of early prototyping studies commonly used in the user-centered design process. Both of these strands of research provide evidence that SBL design crits can fruitfully be used in computing education in order to develop critical thinking and analysis skills, to effect positive attitudinal shifts, and to provide rich opportunities for participation in authentic practices. However, because of the logistical constraints of computing education, the design studio component of SBL proves challenging to adapt. My tal- will conclude with a futuristic vision that leverages contemporary trends in online social networking in order to create ""virtual"" design studios that bring together communities of computing students, mentors, instructors, and industry professionals in unprecedented ways..</p>","","","10.1145/2247569.2247570","","","","","","","","","","","","","","4-5 May 2012","","ACM","ACM Conferences"

In this paper, we demonstrate an Eclipse plug-in called LASE that (1) creates context-aware edit scripts from two or more examples, and uses these scripts to (2) automatically identify edit locations and (3) transform the code. In LASE, users can view syntactic edit operations and corresponding context for each input example. They can also choose a different subset of the examples to adjust the abstraction level of inferred edits. When LASE locates target methods matching the inferred edit context and suggests customized edits, users can review and correct LASEs edit suggestion.

We briefly review the molecular dynamics (MD) algorithm and highlight the main bottlenecks, which involve the calculation of the forces that interact between its substituent particles. We then present new GPU-specific performance optimization techniques for MD simulations, including 1) a parallel Verlet Neighbor List algorithm that is readily implemented using the CUDPP library and 2) a bitwise shift type compression algorithm that decreases data transfer with GPUs. We also evaluate the single vs. double precision implementation of our MD simulation code using well-established biophysical metrics, and we observe negligible differences.

However, organizations are interested in more than just bugs. In particular, they are more concerned about managing risk, i.e., the likelihood that a code or design change will cause a negative impact on their products and processes, regardless of whether or not it introduces a bug. In this paper, we conduct a year-long study involving more than 450 developers of a large enterprise, spanning more than 60 teams, to better understand risky changes, i.e., <i>changes for which developers believe that additional attention is needed in the form of careful code or design reviewing and/or more testing</i>. Our findings show that different developers and different teams have their own criteria for determining risky changes. Using factors extracted from the changes and the history of the files modified by the changes, we are able to accurately identify risky changes with a recall of more than 67%, and a precision improvement of 87% (using developer specific models) and 37% (using team specific models), over a random model. We find that the number of lines and chunks of code added by the change, the bugginess of the files being changed, the number of bug reports linked to a change and the developer experience are the best indicators of change risk. In addition, we find that when a change has many related changes, the reliability of developers in marking risky changes is negatively affected. Our findings and models are being used today in practice to manage the risk of software projects.</p>","","","10.1145/2393596.2393670","","","bug inducing changes;change metrics;change risk;code metrics","","","","","15","","","","","","11-16 Nov. 2012","","ACM","ACM Conferences"

Source code for high value projects, such as the Santa Clara Law website, were previously held in a Subversion (SVN) repository in a client-server model, providing version control and redundancy. Because of the resource footprint associated with SVN, only projects with high importance could be setup with version control. As more web-based applications were introduced, the need for a more efficient revision control system arose. Git, a highly efficient decentralized version control system (DVCS), was selected after evaluating similar technologies. This change transformed the entire development process, making the development cycle more streamlined and with greater flexibility. In the early use of Git, LTAC also discovered its use as a deployment tool, increasing redundancy on servers and reducing overhead usually associated with revision control. It also serves as the vital link between LTAC's issue tracking system, Redmine, and the development team. The introduction of Redmine has helped LTAC monitor website issues, manage projects, and continually review changes to the code base. LTAC has created a development ecosystem that provides redundancy and accountability using open source products that carry no cost. Git has significant performance gains over SVN, making its integration and use less frustrating and distracting for developers. Redmine gives developers and customers the opportunity to organize, track, and resolve issues. The flexibility of the technology used means that any project, from a content management system to a one-off script, can benefit from source control without large costs or long deployment times.</p>","","","10.1145/2382456.2382510","","","GIT;automated deployment;decentralized version control;issue tracking;redmine;source control","","","","","","1","","","","","15-19 Oct. 2012","","ACM","ACM Conferences"

Mina","University of Catanzaro","ACM SIGBioinformatics Record","20160129","2012","2","3","17","18","<p>Bioinformatics approaches to the study of proteins yield to the introduction of different methodologies and related tools for the analysis of different types of data related to proteins, ranging from primary, secondary and tertiary structures to interaction data [1], not to mention functional knowledge.</p> <p>One of the most advanced tools for encoding and representing functional knowledge in a formal way is the Gene Ontology (GO) [2,3]. It is composed of three ontologies, named Biological Process (BP), Molecular Function (MF) and Cellular Component (CC). Each ontology consists of a set of terms (GO terms) representing different functions, biological processes and cellular components within the cell. GO terms are connected each other to form a hierarchical graph. Terms representing similar functions are close to each other within this graph.</p> <p>Biological molecules are associated with GO terms that represent their functions, biological roles and localization. This process, usually referred to as annotation process, can be performed under the supervision of an expert or in a fully automated way. Obviously, computationally inferred annotations, commonly known as Electronically Inferred Annotation (IEA), are not as reliable as experimentally determined annotations. For this reason every annotation is labeled with an Evidence Code (EC) that keeps track of the type of process used to produce the annotation itself. Considering the release of annotations of April, 2010, about the 98% of all the annotations is an IEA annotation [4].</p> <p>The term annotation corpus is commonly used to identify all the annotations involving a set of proteins or genes, usually referring the whole proteomes and genomes (i.e. the annotation corpus of yeast). For lack of space we do not further describe the Gene Ontology. A comprehensive review has been provided by du Plessis et al. [4] and by Guzzi et al. [5].</p> <p>The availability of well formalized functional data enabled the use - f computational methods to analyse genes and proteins from the functional point of view. For example, a set of algorithms, known as functional enrichment algorithms, have been developed to determine the statistical significance of the presence (or the absence) of a GO Term in a set of gene products. A detailed review of these algorithms can be found in [4].</p> <p>An interesting problem is how to express quantitatively the relationships between GO terms. Several measures, referred to as (term) semantic similarity (SS) measures, has been introduced in the last decade. Given two or more GO terms, they try to quantify the similarity of the functional aspects represented by the terms within the cell. Exploiting annotation corpora, semantic similarity measures have been further extended to the evaluation of the similarity of genes and proteins on the basis of their annotations.</p> <p>Many different works have focused on the following tasks: (i) the definition of ad-hoc semantic similarity measures tailored to the characteristics of Gene Ontology; (ii) the definition of measures of comparison of genes and proteins; (iii) the introduction of methodologies for the systematic assessment of semantic similarity measures; (iv) the use of semantic similarity measures in many different contexts and applications. Despite its relevance, the application of semantic similarity for the systematic analysis of protein data is still an open research area. There are, in fact, two main questions that have to be addressed: (i) the systematic assessment of SS with respect to other biological features, i.e. how much an high or a low value of SS is biologically meaningful; (ii) how reliable are the SS themselves, i.e. is there any systematic error or bias in the calculation of SS? Both these problems are relevant for the diffusion of SS measures; while in the first case several approaches have been proposed, confronting SS measures with a pletora of different biological features, only few wo","2159-1210;21591210","","10.1145/2384691.2384694","","","","","","","","1","","","","","","September 2012","","ACM","ACM Journals & Magazines"

On one hand, citizens, academics and nonprofit organizations urged government to further refine product quality supervision strategies and install new food safety monitoring mechanisms (Qu, 2009). On the other, because of the popularity of wireless sensor systems and mobile data collection and transferring technologies in goods production, transferring and processing worldwide, they quickly gained their popularity among Chinese national quality control administration (Ruiz-Garcia et al, 2009; Jiang, 2008). The purpose of this paper is to conduct a comprehensive review of China's newly installed mobile and wireless quality control system based on the analysis of both first hand and second hand data. Specifically the study focuses on how changes in monitoring and tracing technologies interact with the current quality control and food safety administration, goods production and supply, and inspection systems. The paper concludes that although China's food quality control administration did attempt to bring new technology to enforce quality control code, the current implementation of mobile and wireless monitoring tools still demonstrates a highly reactive nature. In addition, the distribution of mobile and wireless monitoring device is still very uneven when it comes to different types of food.

A common approach to tackle this problem is to introduce redundancy, that is, to request multiple workers to work on the same tasks. For simple multiple-choice tasks, several statistical methods to aggregate the multiple answers have been proposed. However, these methods cannot always be applied to more general tasks with unstructured response formats such as article writing, program coding, and logo designing, which occupy the majority on most crowdsourcing marketplaces. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised statistical quality estimation method for such general crowdsourcing tasks. Our method is based on the two-stage procedure; multiple workers are first requested to work on the same tasks in the creation stage, and then another set of workers review and grade each artifact in the review stage. We model the ability of each author and the bias of each reviewer, and propose a two-stage probabilistic generative model using the graded response model in the item response theory. Experiments using several general crowdsourcing tasks show that our method outperforms popular vote aggregation methods, which implies that our method can deliver high quality results with lower costs.</p>","","","10.1145/2487575.2487600","","","crowdsourcing;human computation;quality control","","","","","10","","","","","","11-14 Aug. 2013","","ACM","ACM Conferences"

To facilitate this effort, we created a new online tool that allows instructors to provide feedback efficiently at scale. Our system differs from recently developed alternatives in that it is a branch of an industrial tool originally developed for internal code reviews at Google and used extensively by the open-source community.

Despite extensive research on this topic, it still suffers from difficulties in handling complex object appearance changes caused by factors such as illumination variation, partial occlusion, shape deformation, and camera motion. Therefore, effective modeling of the 2D appearance of tracked objects is a key issue for the success of a visual tracker. In the literature, researchers have proposed a variety of 2D appearance models.</p> <p>To help readers swiftly learn the recent advances in 2D appearance models for visual object tracking, we contribute this survey, which provides a detailed review of the existing 2D appearance models. In particular, this survey takes a module-based architecture that enables readers to easily grasp the key points of visual object tracking. In this survey, we first decompose the problem of appearance modeling into two different processing stages: visual representation and statistical modeling. Then, different 2D appearance models are categorized and discussed with respect to their composition modules. Finally, we address several issues of interest as well as the remaining challenges for future research on this topic.</p> <p>The contributions of this survey are fourfold. First, we review the literature of visual representations according to their feature-construction mechanisms (i.e., local and global). Second, the existing statistical modeling schemes for tracking-by-detection are reviewed according to their model-construction mechanisms: generative, discriminative, and hybrid generative-discriminative. Third, each type of visual representations or statistical modeling techniques is analyzed and discussed from a theoretical or practical viewpoint.

In order to understand research on a particular computing topic, practitioners and researchers often need to obtain an overview of its research methods.

This paper defines and demonstrates RSML, a Research Schema Modelling Language that captures a high level of detail and is applicable to most types of computing research. <i>Method</i>. RSML was designed using concepts from the research methods literature, then refined inductively. An RSML editor was created to assist coders and help reduce coding errors. To demonstrate the feasibility of modelling research with RSML, and to exemplify the summary information that can be derived from a database of RSML encodings, a trial review of 24 articles from one journal was conducted. <i>Results</i>. The review illustrates quantitatively the journal's focus on artifact construction and empiricism. It also reveals that observations are rarely used to inform artifact construction, and purely empirical studies are scarce. <i>Conclusion</i>.

Then, a method is proposed for automatically identifying falling and collision risks and generating DVFs. In this method, workspaces are generated in BIM based on Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) deliverables, the project schedule, the dimensions of equipment, and the geometry of the building. One set of DVFs for collision prevention is generated based on those workspaces. Another set of DVFs is generated where physical barriers are needed for fall prevention. The generated DVFs are used coupled with Real-time Location System (RTLS) tracking of workers and physical fences to check safety requirements and to provide safety warnings.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","9-12 Dec. 2012","","ACM","ACM Conferences"

The findings are mapped against agile principles and it seems that the use of metrics supports the principles with some deviations. Surprisingly, we find little evidence of the use of code metrics.

ADAM supports the discovery of module and runtime views as well as the analysis of quality attributes, such as testability, performance, and maintainability, of software systems. The premise of ADAM is that the implementation constructs, architecture constructs, concerns, and quality attributes are all influenced by the external entities (e.g., libraries, frameworks, COTS software) used by the system under analysis. The analysis uses such external dependencies to identify, classify, and review a minimal set of key source-code files supported by a knowledge base of the external entities. Given the benefits of analyzing external dependencies as a way to discover architectures and potential risks, it is demonstrated that dependencies to external entities are useful not only for architecture discovery but also for analysis of quality attributes. ADAM is evaluated using the NASA's Space Network Access System (SNAS). The results show that this method offers systematic guidelines for discovering the architecture and locating potential risks (e.g., low testability and decreased performance) that are hidden deep inside the system implementation. Some generally applicable lessons for developers and analysts, as well as threats to validity are also discussed.</p>","1049-331X;1049331X","","10.1145/2529998","","","Concerns;external entities;knowledge base;maintainability;module and runtime views;quality;reverse engineering;software architecture;testability","","","","","","","","","","","March 2014","","ACM","ACM Journals & Magazines"

Compilers have traditionally focused on optimizations to code that improve performance, but is that the right target to speed up real applications? Consider loading a web page (like starting GMAIL) the page is transferred to the client, any JavaScript is compiled, the JavaScript executes, and the page gets displayed. The classic compiler model (which was first developed in the late 50's) was a great fit for single core machines but has fallen behind architecture, and language. For example how do you compile a single program for a machine that has both a CPU and a graphics coprocessor (a GPU) with a very different programming and memory model? Together with the changes in architecture there have been changes in programming languages. Dynamic languages are used more, static languages are used less. How does this effect compiler research? In this talk, I'll review a number of traditional compiler research challenges that have (or will) become burning issues and will describe some new problems areas that were not considered in the past. For example language specifica-tions are large complex technical documents that are difficult for non-experts to follow.

Supplementary Parity Augmentation (SPA), unlike the pyramid code, which has two parities covering half of the arrays disks each, extends RAID5's P parity with an additional S parity, which covers half of the disks. The extra load with respect to RAID5 of updating the S parity by one half of the disks is compensated by the more efficient on demand reconstructtion and rebuild processing when a disk fails. Although SPA has the same disk space redundancy level as RAID6, unlike RAID6 it can only deal with roughly half of all possible double disk failure cases for eight disks. For rebuild processing SPA reads half of the disks required by RAID5 and this leads to a higher Mean Time to Data Loss than RAID5, since fewer Latent Sector Errors are encountered. We review performance and reliability modeling of RAID5 arrays to provide insights into SPA's performance and reliability, which cannot be gained from numerical results alone. SPA is outperformed by the Intra-Disk Redundancy schemes combined with RAID5, which results in RAID6's reliability and RAID5 performance.</p>","0163-5964;01635964","","10.1145/2234336.2234340","","","","","","","","","1","","","","","May 2012","","ACM","ACM Journals & Magazines"

A fifth developer is born and educated in Australia. For this group familiarity with algorithms and decades of temporal lives with computers for play was the norm. These characters as a social group who have not only experienced thousands of hours with rules of play but are players as consumers who have now switched to development.

Working towards this aim, it presents a video-coding framework that supports the granular identification of epistemic actions (physical actions that are made to simplify cognitive work) during tangible tasks. The framework includes 20 epistemic actions, identified through a systematic literature review of 77 sources.

China","Proceedings of the 5th Asia-Pacific Symposium on Internetware","20160129","2013","","","1","4","<p>It is encouraged to develop practical approaches to ensure that the software artifacts are created as expected or defect-free as early as possible. In the industry, software analysis and testing techniques are widely used solutions for codes and executables, respectively. However, software design artifacts can only be verified by manual peer review in design phase. In this paper, we propose an approach to automatically simulate the expected software behavior depicted in UML activity diagrams. First, UML activity diagrams are parsed and initialized semantically with a concrete execution. Second, the model is symbolically executed, to collect paths, input variables, and their path conditions. Then, the path conditions are passed to a constraint solver to generate a set of concrete value of possible input variables. Final, the generated concrete input variables are semantically executed on the model to identify the defects as well as to collect the execution path. The model simulation approach reuses the design models, automates the simulation process by using model-based concolic execution, and has the advantage of visibility and observability on model simulation. In addition, we found that the solvable paths represent behavioral scenarios. While simulating the model, input values corresponding to execution paths in the model are generated automatically. They can also be used as test suites to find the inconsistency between the design and implementation. We have also developed a prototype tool to support the above process, and have conducted a trivial case study to demonstrate the applicability of our approach.</p>","","","10.1145/2532443.2532465","","","UML activity diagram;concolic execution;simulation;tool","","","","","","","","","","","23-24 Oct. 2013","","ACM","ACM Conferences"

This includes identifying possible attacks or threat scenarios that target the system and may result in breaching of system security. Additionally we may also assess the strength of the system and its security architecture using well-known security metrics such as system attack surface, Compartmentalization, least-privilege, etc. However, existing efforts are limited to specific, predefined security properties or scenarios that are checked either manually or using limited toolsets. We introduce a new approach to support architecture security analysis using security scenarios and metrics. Our approach is based on formalizing attack scenarios and security metrics signature specification using the Object Constraint Language (OCL). Using formal signatures we analyse a target system to locate signature matches (for attack scenarios), or to take measurements (for security metrics). New scenarios and metrics can be incorporated and calculated provided that a formal signature can be specified. Our approach supports defining security metrics and scenarios at architecture, design, and code levels. We have developed a prototype software system architecture security analysis tool. To the best of our knowledge this is the first extensible architecture security risk analysis tool that supports both metric-based and scenario-based architecture security analysis. We have validated our approach by using it to capture and evaluate signatures from the NIST security principals and attack scenarios defined in the CAPEC database. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","12","","","","","","18-26 May 2013","","ACM","ACM Conferences"

"Situational awareness: personalizing issue tracking systems","O. Baysal; R. Holmes; M. W. Godfrey","University of Waterloo, Canada","Proceedings of the 2013 International Conference on Software Engineering","20160129","2013","","","1185","1188","<p> Issue tracking systems play a central role in ongoing software development; they are used by developers to support collaborative bug fixing and the implementation of new features, but they are also used by other stakeholders including managers, QA, and end-users for tasks such as project management, communication and discussion, code reviews, and history tracking. Most such systems are designed around the central metaphor of the ""issue"" (bug, defect, ticket, feature, etc.), yet increasingly this model seems ill fitted to the practical needs of growing software projects; for example, our analysis of interviews with 20 Mozilla developers who use Bugzilla heavily revealed that developers face challenges maintaining a global understanding of the issues they are involved with, and that they desire improved support for situational awareness that is difficult to achieve with current issue management systems. In this paper we motivate the need for personalized issue tracking that is centered around the information needs of individual developers together with improved logistical support for the tasks they perform. We also describe an initial approach to implement such a system — extending Bugzilla — that enhances a developer's situational awareness of their working context by providing views that are tailored to specific tasks they frequently perform; we are actively improving this prototype with input from Mozilla developers. </p>","","","","","","","","","","","3","","","","","","18-26 May 2013","","ACM","ACM Conferences"

The purpose of this study was to explore and compare both the feasibility and utility of having community residents use two different technological devices to assess their neighborhood built environment features: the Stanford Healthy Neighborhood Discovery Tool (which allows users to thoughtfully take photographs) and the SenseCam (which automatically takes photographs). Consented participants were low income, tech-naïve, Latino adolescents aged 11 to 14 years (n=8), and older adults aged 63 to 80 years (n=7) from North Fair Oaks, California. Participants used the devices while on a ""usual"" 45 to 60 minute walk through their neighborhood. Photos from each device were reviewed, coded, categorized into themes, and compared. Perceptual data regarding the use of the SenseCam were available for 15 participants and SenseCam photographs were available for 7 participants. There were 1,678 photos automatically captured by the SenseCam compared to 112 photos taken by participants with the Discovery Tool. Of the original 1,678 SenseCam photos there were 68 in which researchers coded built environment features that were not captured by the community residents using the Discovery Tool. Forty-two (62%) of these photos were of positive features; and 26 (38%) were of negative features. The SenseCam captured a greater number of images with positive features that were not captured by adolescents via the Discovery Tool; as well as a greater number of negative features not captured by the older adults via the Discovery Tool. There were two environmental elements (graffiti, dogs) captured by the Discovery Tool though not the SenseCam. Overall, study participants were receptive to both devices and indicated that they would be interested in using them again for a longer period of time. Older adults reported more positive perceptions about- the SenseCam than adolescents. While the sample was small, study results indicate that the SenseCam may be useful in capturing built environment features that affect physical activity but that community residents don't notice, perhaps because they are habituated to certain conditions in their neighborhoods. The results suggest that this type of habituation may have different valences (positive or negative) for different age groups. Given the impact the built environment has on physical activity, particularly in low-income communities, further research regarding the use of the SenseCam to passively gather built environment data in tech-naïve populations is warranted.</p>","","","10.1145/2526667.2526669","","","SenseCam;applications;behavioral science;mHealth;older adults;physical activity;tablet","","","","","","","","","","","18-19 Nov. 2013","","ACM","ACM Conferences"

This is fueled largely by dramatic growth in data volumes that may be associated with many matters and investigations. Potential review populations frequently exceed several hundred thousands documents, and document counts in the millions are not uncommon. Budgetary and/or time constraints often make a once traditional linear review of these populations impractical, if not impossible - which made ""predictive coding"" the most discussed TAR approach in recent years. A key challenge in any predictive coding approach is striking the appropriate balance in training the system. The goal is to minimize the time that Subject Matter Experts spend in training the system, while making sure that they perform enough training to achieve acceptable classification performance over the entire review population. Recent research demonstrates that Support Vector Machines (SVM) perform very well in finding a compact, yet effective, training dataset in an iterative fashion using batch-mode active learning. However, this research is limited. Additionally, these efforts have not led to a principled approach for determining the stabilization of the active learning process. In this paper, we propose and compare several batch-mode active learning methods which are integrated within SVM learning algorithm. We also propose methods for determining the stabilization of the active learning method. Experimental results on a set of large-scale, real-life legal document collections validate the superiority of our method over the existing methods for this task.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-9926-2; POD:978-1-4799-9927-9","10.1109/BigData.2015.7363867","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7363867","","Law;Measurement;Predictive coding;Support vector machines;Training;Uncertainty","document handling;learning (artificial intelligence);support vector machines","SVM;batch-mode active learning;document review process;litigation discovery;predictive coding;support vector machine;technology-assisted review","","","","36","","","","Oct. 29 2015-Nov. 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

During user evaluations, it became evident that users often wanted to see the code changes at a higher level of abstraction. Therefore, we developed a novel approach to automatically summarize fine-grained code changes into more conceptual, higher-level changes in real time. Our system provides four collapse levels, which are integrated with the timeline via semantic zooming: raw level (no collapsing), statement level, method level, and type level. Compared to the raw level, the number of code changes shown in the timeline at each level is reduced by 55%, 77%, and 83%, respectively. This implies that the semantic zooming would help users better understand and interact with the history by minimizing the potential information overload.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-7457-6; POD:978-1-4673-7458-3","10.1109/VLHCC.2015.7357203","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7357203","Azurite;edit collapsing;program comprehension;semantic zooming;software visualization;timeline visualization","","programming environments;user interfaces","code change history;method level;raw level;semantic zooming;statement level;type level","","","","17","","","","18-22 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The purpose of this study is to analyze the nature of faculty peer comments generated throughout the peer feedback process. Each peer-generated video annotation text file was coded to characterize the type of feedback given, encompassing characterizations such as: good practice, suggestions; types of teacher knowledge; and general attributes of teaching. The demographics of the peer authors, for corresponding annotations, are also classified based on highest degree, familiarity with the course as an instructor, and familiarity as a student. Findings indicate that a majority of the comments are related to the direct instruction of the course, rather than the content of the instruction. While not statistically significant, familiarity with the course as instructor is positively correlated to the number of comments pertaining to pedagogical content knowledge. These findings support the need for peer-review by faculty familiar with the course to offer context specific suggestions as well as those peers unfamiliar with the course to offer opportunities to diffuse instructional strategies from other contexts.","","Paper:978-1-4799-8454-1","10.1109/FIE.2015.7344392","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7344392","faculty peer review;professional development","Context;Education;Organizations;Portfolios;Reflection;Reliability;Streaming media","computer aided instruction;demography;educational courses;further education;teaching","VAPR;asynchronous peer review;asynchronous video-annotated peer review system;classroom teaching;course;faculty feedback;higher education;instructional strategies;pedagogical content knowledge;pedagogical practice;peer feedback process;peer-generated video annotation text file;professional demographics;research-based teaching approaches;video recording","","","","39","","","","21-24 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Malachowsky","Rochester Institute of Technology","2015 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE)","20151207","2015","","","1","6","Software development teams face a critical threat to the security of their systems: insiders. A malicious insider is a person who violates an authorized level of access in a software system. Unfortunately, when creating software, developers do not typically account for insider threat. Students learning software development are unaware of the impacts of malicious actors and are far too often untrained in prevention methods against them. A few of the defensive mechanisms to protect against insider threats include eliminating system access once an employee leaves an organization, enforcing principle of least privilege, code reviews, and constant monitoring for suspicious activity. At the Department of Software Engineering at the Rochester Institute of Technology, we require a course titled Engineering of Secure Software and have created an activity designed to prepare students for the problem of insider threats. At the beginning of this activity, student teams are given the task of designing a moderately sized secure software system. The goal of this insider is to manipulate the team into creating a flawed system design that would allow attackers to perform malicious activities once the system has been created. When the insider is revealed at the conclusion of the project, students discuss countermeasures regarding the malicious actions the insiders were able to plan or complete, along with methods of prevention that may have been employed by the team to detect the malicious developer. In this paper, we describe the activity along with the results of a survey. We discuss the benefits and challenges of the activity with the goal of giving other instructors the tools they need to conduct this activity at their institution. While many institutions do not offer courses in computer security, this self-contained activity may be used in any computing course to enforce the importance of protecting against insider threats.","","Paper:978-1-4799-8454-1","10.1109/FIE.2015.7344087","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7344087","Computing Education;Software Engineering;Software Security","Cryptography;Databases;Organizations;Software engineering;Software systems","computer aided instruction;computer science education;educational courses;educational institutions;engineering education;invasive software;safety-critical software","Rochester Institute of Technology;authorized access level violation;computer security;defensive mechanisms;department of software engineering;engineering-of-secure software course;insider threat activity;malicious activities;malicious actors;malicious insider;secure software system design;self-contained activity;software development learning;software development teams;software security course;software system","","1","","18","","","","21-24 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To a broad extent, securitybreaches are not due to problems in cryptography nor in thecommunication medium or in computer hardware and microprocessors. In turn, software vulnerabilities are mainly due to limitations in current state of the art software testing. Unfortunately, no major breakthrough in software testing is expected, neither at this time nor in the near future. To this end, researchers tackled the problem of platform security from a different perspective: dividing the platform into two orthogonal execution environments: trusted execution environment (TEE) and untrusted or rich execution environment (REE). In the latter, a rich execution environment hosting unrestricted commercial off-the-shelf software executes, while in the former a minimalistic highly trusted software stack executes. Execution takes place most of the time in the REE, while only sensitive and security critical operations take place in the TEE. In this paper, we review and discuss the required and highly recommended properties that any code executing in the TEE must preserve, and we show how software, security and machine architects should cooperate for maintaining a secure TEE orthogonal to a rich REE in embedded computing devices.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-7952-6; POD:978-1-4673-7953-3","10.1109/Trustcom.2015.495","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7345403","Software testing;rich execution environment REE;trusted execution environment TEE;trusted software","Cryptography;Formal verification;Measurement;Software;Software testing","cryptography;program testing;trusted computing","REE;TEE;cryptography;embedded computing devices;rich execution environment;security breach;software testing;software vulnerabilities;trusted execution environment;trustworthy software systems","","","","32","","","","20-22 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, I will point out the shortcomings and limitations of current cloud computing programming models for typical scientific computing algorithms, and propose possible solutions. Current cloud models such as MapReduce or Spark and their variants have succeeded in data-parallel applications such as database operations and web searching; however, they are still not effective for applications with a lot of data dependency such as scientific computing applications. We propose several approaches to solving this problem through extension of current programming models, automatic translation from sequential codes to cloud codes, simple API and framework built on current cloud models and traditional models such as MPI, detection of data and task parallelism, and their efficient scheduling. Some preliminary theoretical and experimental results will also be reported in this talk.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-7952-6; POD:978-1-4673-7953-3","10.1109/Trustcom.2015.348","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7345256","","","application program interfaces;cloud computing;message passing;parallel processing;scientific information systems;search engines","API;MPI;MapReduce;OpenMP;Spark;Web search;cloud codes;cloud computing programming models;cloud programming models;computing domains;data detection;data utilities;data-parallel applications;database applications;database operations;legacy scientific computing codes;massively parallel computing platforms;on-demand access;parallel programming languages;parallelism task;scheduling;sequential codes;software utilities;usage-based billing model","","","","","","","","20-22 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As such, they have been subject to intensive research regarding their detection and impact on understandability and changeability of source code. However, current methods do not support highly configurable software systems, that is, systems that can be customized to fit a wide range of requirements or platforms. Such systems commonly owe their configurability to conditional compilation based on C preprocessor annotations (a. k. a. #ifdefs). Since annotations directly interact with the host language (e. g., C), they may have adverse effects on understandability and changeability of source code, referred to as variability-aware code smells. In this paper, we propose a metric-based method that integrates source code and C preprocessor annotations to detect such smells. We evaluate our method for one specific smell on five open-source systems of medium size, thus, demonstrating its general applicability. Moreover, we manually reviewed 100 instances of the smell and provide a qualitative analysis of its potential impact as well as common causes for the occurrence.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-7529-0; POD:978-1-4673-7530-6","10.1109/SCAM.2015.7335413","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7335413","","Computer bugs;Concrete;Measurement;Open source software;Programming;Scattering;Software systems","C language;program diagnostics;public domain software;source code (software)","C preprocessor annotation;metric-based detection;open-source system;source code;variability-aware code smell","","","","32","","","","27-28 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

On the basis of analyzing reviews discussed by 2000+ developers, our results indicate that quicker closure of reviews owned by a developer relates to higher reception of information and insights from peers. However, we also find evidence that higher engagement in collaboration by a developer is associated with slower closure of the reviews she owns.

Unfortunately, it is often difficult for network carriers and ISPs to reproduce these investigations on their networks. This is partially because of the absence of a software planning tool, meeting the requirements of industry and academia, which can make the adaptation and validation of planning algorithms less time consuming. We describe how a paradigm shift to an open source view of the network planning field emphasizes the power of distributed peer review and transparency to create high-quality software at an accelerated pace and lower cost. Then we present Net2Plan, an open source Java-based software tool. Built on top of a technology-agnostic network representation, it automates the elaboration of performance evaluation tests for userdefined or built-in network design algorithms, network recovery schemes, connection-admission-control systems, or dynamic provisioning algorithms for timevarying traffic. The Net2Plan philosophy enforces code reutilization as an open repository of network planning resources. In this article, a case study in a multilayer IP-over-WDM network is presented to illustrate the potential of Net2Plan. We cover standard CAPEX studies, and more advanced aspects such as a resilience analysis of the network under random independent failures and disaster scenarios, and an energy efficiency assessment of “green” schemes that switch off parts of the network during low load periods.

A tool for ranking all the source files with respect to how likely they are to contain the cause of the bug would enable developers to narrow down their search and improve productivity. This paper introduces an adaptive ranking approach that leverages project knowledge through functional decomposition of source code, API descriptions of library components, the bug-fixing history, the code change history, and the file dependency graph. Given a bug report, the ranking score of each source file is computed as a weighted combination of an array of features, where the weights are trained automatically on previously solved bug reports using a learning-to-rank technique. We evaluate the ranking system on six large scale open source Java projects, using the before-fix version of the project for every bug report. The experimental results show that the learning-to-rank approach outperforms three recent state-of-the-art methods. In particular, our method makes correct recommendations within the top 10 ranked source files for over 70 percent of the bug reports in the Eclipse Platform and Tomcat projects.","0098-5589;00985589","","10.1109/TSE.2015.2479232","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7270328","Bug reports;learning to rank;software maintenance","Benchmark testing;Collaboration;Computational modeling;Computer bugs;History;Software;Standards","","","","1","","72","","","20150916","April 1 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

An approach for identifying vulnerable code is to identify its attack surface, the sum of all paths for untrusted data into and out of a system. Identifying the code that lies on the attack surface requires expertise and significant manual effort. This paper proposes an automated technique to empirically approximate attack surfaces through the analysis of stack traces. We hypothesize that stack traces from user-initiated crashes have several desirable attributes for measuring attack surfaces. The goal of this research is to aid software engineers in prioritizing security efforts by approximating the attack surface of a system via stack trace analysis. In a trial on Windows 8, the attack surface approximation selected 48.4% of the binaries and contained 94.6% of known vulnerabilities. Compared with vulnerability prediction models (VPMs) run on the entire codebase, VPMs run on the attack surface approximation improved recall from .07 to .1 for binaries and from .02 to .05 for source files.

One way to address the quality of such systems is through testing. Software testing provides software providers and their clients with techniques to characterize the internal and external quality of their systems, by specifying test cases to check how systems react under different circumstances. In the context of web services the situation changes, software providers become service providers. In other words, they do not provide a physical software to their clients, instead they allow them to invoke remote code from their system. This change affects the way we look at testing itself. In the web service paradigm clients do not own services, instead they invoke them. Different approaches for testing web services have been reported in the literature, with different techniques and using different input information to generate test cases. Considering the topic of web services testing, as a subject for this systematic review is a challenging undertaking, mainly due to the extensive amount of literature in the subject. To narrow it, we have focused on one single particularity that affects dramatically the testing process. That is the specifications used to generate test cases. To this end, in this paper we present a systematic review of the specifications used for testing web services.

GitHub has been found to create a transparent development environment, which together with a pull request-based workflow, provides a lightweight mechanism for committing, reviewing and managing code changes. These features impact how GitHub is used and the benefits it provides to teams' development and collaboration. While most of the evidence we have is from GitHub's use in open source software (OSS) projects, GitHub is also used in an increasing number of commercial projects. It is unknown how GitHub supports these projects given that GitHub's workflow model does not intuitively fit the commercial development way of working. In this paper, we report findings from an online survey and interviews with GitHub users on how GitHub is used for collaboration in commercial projects. We found that many commercial projects adopted practices that are more typical of OSS projects including reduced communication, more independent work, and self-organization. We discuss how GitHub's transparency and popular workflow can promote open collaboration, allowing organizations to increase code reuse and promote knowledge sharing across their teams.","0270-5257;02705257","Electronic:978-1-4799-1934-5; POD:978-1-4799-1935-2","10.1109/ICSE.2015.74","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7194607","GitHub;collaboration;commercial projects;coordination;open source;practices;pull requests;workflow","Collaborative software;Encoding;Interviews;Organizations;Software;Writing","computer software;public domain software","GitHub users;OSS projects;built-in social features;code changes;commercial projects;knowledge sharing;online code hosting service;open source software projects;open source-style collaborative development practices;pull request-based workflow;self-organization;transparent development environment","","9","","49","","","","16-24 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Alignment is a key factor for success in many software development projects. Aligned teams are capable of bringing collaboration and positive results to companies; whereas misalignment among developers can make a conflicted environment and even lead the project to failure. OBJECTIVE. To assist developers in an embedded software development company in their conceptual alignment regarding source code quality. METHOD. In the organizational context, plan and perform a series of studies such as surveys, systematic literature review (SLR), qualitative data analysis and focus group to support the identification of conceptual misalignments among developers and establish common terminology and guidance concerning source code quality. RESULTS. The results from a survey conducted in one company showed a conceptual misalignment among developers regarding the source code quality that was triggering continuous rework during software evolution activities. Through an SLR and a qualitative analysis of code snippets, a set of evidence-based coding guidelines for readability and understandability of source code were formulated. These guidelines were evaluated and used as an instrument for aligning source code perspectives during a focus group, showing their feasibility and adequacy to the company's context. CONCLUSIONS. The use of all contextual information observed - e.g. teams' locations, software development context, and time constraints - along with the information gathered during the industry-academia collaboration was particularly important to help us appropriately chose research methods to be used, and formulate evidence-based coding guidelines that matched the company's needs and expectations. Further evaluations have to be carried out to ensure the quality impact of some guidelines proposed before using them all over the company.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-7028-8; POD:978-1-4673-7029-5","10.1109/CESI.2015.12","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7167423","code quality;conceptual alignment;experimental studies;industry-academia collaboration","Bibliographies;Collaboration;Companies;Context;Encoding;Guidelines;Software","software quality;source code (software)","SLR;code snippets;conceptual misalignment;embedded software development company;evidence-based coding guidelines;industry-academia collaboration;qualitative data analysis;software development projects;software evolution activity;source code quality alignment;systematic literature review","","0","","10","","","","18-18 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is important to include the coupling in the circuit simulation self-consistently because this allows us to accurately predict the responses to various EMI/EMC problems of interest. It is also important to predict circuit responses efficiently because that opens the door to statistical applications for the technique being used. In this paper, we review a technique that we have developed called A Thevenin Equivalent Network Approach.

Sharing tangled commits is problematic because it makes review, reversion, and integration of these commits harder and historical analyses of the project less reliable. Researchers have worked at untangling existing commits, i.e., finding which part of a commit relates to which task. In this paper, we contribute to this line of work in two ways: (1) A publicly available dataset of untangled code changes, created with the help of two developers who accurately split their code changes into self contained tasks over a period of four months; (2) a novel approach, EpiceaUntangler, to help developers share untangled commits (aka. atomic commits) by using fine-grained code change information. EpiceaUntangler is based and tested on the publicly available dataset, and further evaluated by deploying it to 7 developers, who used it for 2 weeks.

In order to help practitioners deal with this paradox, this thesis aims to understand and improve the integration process of modern software organizations. We took the Linux kernel as our pilot case study, which is supported by a distributed version control system (Git) and low-tech reviewing system (mailing list). So far, we have (1) analyzed how to reconstruct the data of the integration process in a low-tech environment where reviews are stored in emails without explicit link to version control commits, and (2) studied the characteristics of the Linux integration process.

Energy harvesting brings new dimensions to the wireless communication problem in the form of intermittency and randomness of available energy, which necessitates a fresh look at wireless communication protocols at the physical, medium access, and networking layers. Scheduling and optimization aspects of energy harvesting communications in the medium access and networking layers have been relatively wellunderstood and surveyed in the recent paper [1]. This branch of literature takes a physical layer rate-power relationship that is valid in energy harvesting conditions under large-enough batteries and long-enough durations between energy harvests so that information-theoretic asymptotes are achieved, and optimizes the transmit power over time in order to maximize the throughput. Another branch of recent literature aims to understand the fundamental capacity limits, i.e. information-theoretic capacities, of energy harvesting links under smaller scale dynamics, considering energy harvests at the channel use level. This branch necessitates a deeper look at the coding and transmission schemes in the physical layer, and ultimately aims to develop an information theory of energy harvesting communications, akin to Shannon's development of an information theory for average power constrained communications. In this introductory article, we survey recent results in this branch and point to open problems that could be of interest to a broad set of researchers in the fields of communication theory, information theory, signal processing, and netw- rking. In particular, we review capacities of energy harvesting links with infinite-sized, finitesized, and no batteries at the transmitter.","0163-6804;01636804","","10.1109/MCOM.2015.7081085","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7081085","","Batteries;Channel capacity;Energy harvesting;Transmitters;Wireless networks","energy harvesting;information theory;optimisation;protocols;radiocommunication;telecommunication scheduling","Shannons development;coding schemes;energy harvesting communications optimization;energy harvesting communications scheduling;energy harvesting devices;information theory;information-theoretic asymptotes;transmission schemes;wireless communication protocols;wireless networks","","23","","15","","","","April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Specifically, freshman- and senior-level, project-based classes have been designed to both teach significant and appropriate academic content, while also building software games and apps for children with cognitive and/or physical disabilities within the university's associated hospital. Children with disabilities provide the context for these courses, while the content remains representative of a traditional curriculum. The cadence of the course(s) is typically: propose, pitch, form groups, design, build, test, and improve. Each student submits a written proposal for the project. A group of experts read all of the proposals, and choose the `best' for pitching to the other students in the course. Groups are formed, using student preferences, based upon the pitches. The newly formed groups follow an engineering process that includes gathering requirements and designing the software system. Student groups partition the work, and implement three iterations (alpha, beta, final) of their designs. Groups are re-formed, and the newly formed groups test code from each other's groups. Finally, original development groups have the ability to make final improvements to their code. Student groups are offered the opportunity to continue work on promising projects through subsequent independent studies or internships. If the software project is `minimally viable', the groups are encouraged to continue development and work with the university's Center for Entrepreneurship or Office of Technology Transfer toward eventual commercialization. During the past academic year (2013-2014), one of the senior-level courses had the singular focus of developing software apps and games for a 13 year old girl with athetoid cerebral palsy. Her family was actively involved in the course, filt- ring project ideas and offering suggestions for improvement. Some of the most promising apps are currently installed in the family's house for methodical review and eventual improvement. This paper will discuss the general process that is used in this style of course, the specific approach that was used during the 2013-2014 academic year, and offer general suggestions for implementation in disciplines other than computer science.","0190-5848;01905848","Electronic:978-1-4799-3922-0; POD:978-1-4799-3923-7; USB:978-1-4799-3921-3","10.1109/FIE.2014.7044467","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7044467","collaborative learning;social context;software engineering","Computer science;Context;Educational institutions;Games;Hospitals;Proposals;Software","computer games;computer science;educational courses;handicapped aids","Center for Entrepreneurship;Office of Technology Transfer;University of Michigan;academic content;apps;athetoid cerebral palsy;children with cognitive disabilities;children with physical disabilities;freshman-level;l computer science curriculum;project-based classes;senior-level;social context;software games;software project","","0","","12","","","","22-25 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There are several challenges associated with automated testing of such web-driven applications. Test developers often need to write several lines of automation scripts which is time consuming, needs excellent programming knowledge and results in different coding styles. Moreover, these are error prone. i.e. test developers tend to write workarounds for complex scenarios. Hence these code needs to go through several review phases to stabilize them. Further, code maintenance is difficult and time consuming for frequent changes in product design. Any change in the flow of test case requires code changes and testing of the code. Hence this is difficult to fit in Agile world. In order to overcome the above challenges, we propose a Model-driven test framework called WaFeR. Here, different use cases or application scenarios on the web application will be modeled as the test cases in the framework. Thus, we model the application scenarios (or flows) as the test cases. In addition to solving the above problems, it has many other inherent advantages. For example, the proposed model allows users to incorporate useful features as utility functions. Further, the intelligence is coded into the framework to understand logical and semantic errors in your test flow.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-4141-4; POD:978-1-4799-8858-7","10.1109/ITPRO.2014.7029298","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7029298","","Cloud computing;Educational institutions;Industries;Semiconductor device modeling;Software as a service;Testing","Internet;product design;program testing;user interfaces","Agile world;SaaS;WaFeR;Web 2.0;Web UI-based application testing;automation scripts;cloud computing;code maintenance;logical errors;model-driven test-framework;product design;semantic errors;software as a service;utility functions","","0","","","","","","22-22 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Supporting Reviewing of Warnings in Presence of Shared Variables: Need and Effectiveness","T. Muske","Tata Res.

Sound static analysis of resulted clusters requires conservative approach for the inter-cluster communication implemented through shared variables. We observe, this approach adds to the large number of warnings generated due to imprecision of static analysis. Further, manual reviewing of warnings resulted due to shared variables takes much more efforts as compared to efforts required in reviewing of the other class of warnings. This paper aims to assist reviewing of such warnings impacted by the shared variables so that reviewing effort is reduced. This is achieved by identification and reporting of suitable information about the impacting shared variables. The reported information includes - 1) marked warnings affected due to shared variables, 2) shared variables present in the code (such as warning point, and code slice) traversed while reviewing a warning, 3) intelligently selected write-points of the involved shared variables, depending on the type of warning, and 4) characteristics of the shared variables extracted from the code, that could potentially help to reduce the efforts further. Our experiments on two embedded systems indicated that the review assisting information presented to the user is quite effective to improve reviewing of warnings affected due to shared variables. The overall reduction in manual efforts varied from 45-70% depending on code size and complexity, type of warnings, reviewer skills, tool support used, etc.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-7377-4; POD:978-1-4799-7378-1","10.1109/ISSREW.2014.85","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6983812","Clustering;False Positives;Manual Review of Warnings;Shared variables;Static Analysis","Arrays;Conferences;Embedded systems;Indexes;Manuals;Software engineering","program diagnostics;software quality","clustering method;code slice;intercluster communication;shared variables;static analysis;warning point","","0","","11","","","","3-6 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We utilize a bottom-up approach, starting with a broad exploratory study including QVTo expert interviews, a review of existing material, and introspection. We then formalize QVTo transformation quality into a QVTo quality model, consisting of high-level quality goals, quality properties, and evaluation procedures. We validate the quality model by conducting a survey in which a broader group of QVTo developers rate each property on its importance to QVTo code quality. We find that although many quality properties recognized as important for QVTo do have counterparts in traditional languages, a number are specific to QVTo or model transformation languages. Additionally, a selection of QVTo best practices discovered are presented. The primary contribution of this paper is a QVTo quality model relevant to QVTo practitioners, while secondary contributions are a bottom-up approach to building a quality model and a validation approach leveraging developer perceptions to evaluate individual quality properties.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-6132-0; Electronic:978-1-4799-6133-7; POD:978-1-4799-6134-4","10.1109/QUATIC.2014.18","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6984096","","Best practices;Data models;Interviews;Measurement;Software;Standards;Unified modeling language","object-oriented programming;software quality;specification languages","OMG standard;QVT operational mappings;QVTo code quality;QVTo quality model;QVTo transformation quality;bottom-up quality model;evaluation procedures;high-level quality goals;model transformation languages;model-to-model transformations;object management group;quality properties","","2","","35","","","","23-26 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Writing Acceptable Patches: An Empirical Study of Open Source Project Patches","Y. Tao; D. Han; S. Kim","","2014 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution","20141206","2014","","","271","280","Software developers submit patches to handle tens or even hundreds of bugs reported daily. However, not all submitted patches can be directly integrated into the code base, since they might not pass patch review that is adopted in most software projects. As the result of patch review, incoming patches can be rejected or asked for resubmission after improvement. Both scenarios interrupt the workflow of patch writers and reviewers, increase their workload, and potentially delay the general development process. In this paper, we aim to help developers write acceptable patches to avoid patch rejection and resubmission. To this end, we derive a comprehensive list of patch rejection reasons from a manual inspection of 300 rejected Eclipse and Mozilla patches, a large-scale online survey of Eclipse and Mozilla developers, and the literature. We also investigate which patch-rejection reasons are more decisive and which are difficult to judge from the perspective of patch reviewers. Our findings include 1) suboptimal solution and incomplete fix are the most frequent patch-rejection reasons 2) whether a patch introduces new bugs is very important yet very difficult to judge 3) reviewers reject a large patch not solely because of its size, but mainly because of the underlying reasons that induce its large size, such as the involvement of unnecessary changes 4) reviewers consider certain problems to be much more destructive than patch writers expect, such as the inconsistency of documentation in a patch and 5) bad timing of patch submission and a lack of communication with team members can also result in a negative patch review.","1063-6773;10636773","Electronic:978-1-4799-6146-7; POD:978-1-4799-6147-4","10.1109/ICSME.2014.49","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6976093","empirical study;patch","Computer bugs;Documentation;Encoding;Guidelines;Inspection;Manuals","program debugging;program diagnostics;software development management","Eclipse developers;Eclipse patches;Mozilla developers;Mozilla patches;acceptable patch writing;codebase;open source project patches;patch rejection;patch resubmission;patch reviewers;software bugs;software developers;software development process;software projects","","6","","38","","","","Sept. 29 2014-Oct. 3 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the long term, this practice becomes a limitation for growth due to redundant maintenance efforts or wasted synergy and cross selling potentials. To mitigate this limitation, customized copies need to be consolidated into a single, variable code base of a software product line (SPL). However, consolidation is tedious as one must identify and correlate differences between the copies to design future variability. For one, existing consolidation approaches lack support of the implementation level. In addition, approaches in the fields of difference analysis and feature detection are not sufficiently integrated for finding relationships between code modifications. In this paper, we present remedy to this problem by integrating a difference analysis with a program dependency analysis based on Program Dependency Graphs (PDG) to reduce the effort of consolidating developers when identifying dependent differences and deriving clusters to consider in their variability design. We successfully evaluated our approach on variants of the open source ArgoUML modeling tool, reducing the manual review effort about 72% with a precision of 99% and a recall of 80%.

Adaptive Case Management (ACM) is gaining interest among researchers and practitioners as an emerging paradigm to master situations in which adaptions have to be made at run-time by so called knowledge workers. In contrast to workflow management the ACM paradigm is not dictating knowledge workers a predefined course of action, but provides them with the required information at the right time and authorizes them to make decisions on their own. Understanding current research challenges imposed by ACM is of utmost importance for the future evolution of this discipline as well as for the maturity of the BPM field. In this paper we present 77 codes referring to research challenges in ACM that have been revealed from an extensive literature review with scientific publications and books. We aggregated these codes to 13 concepts and categorized them into five distinct areas for data integration, theoretical foundation, authorization and role management, knowledge worker empowerment as well as knowledge storage and extraction.

Contracts explicitly describe component behaviour, reducing development risk by exposing potential incompatibilities early in the development process. But to benefit fully from reuse, developers of safety-critical systems must also reuse safety evidence. Full reuse would require both extending the existing notion of component contracts to cover safety properties and using these contracts in both component selection and system certification. This is not as simple as it first appears. Much of the review, analysis, and test evidence developers provide during certification is system-specific. This makes it difficult to define safety contracts that facilitate both selecting components to reuse and certifying systems. In this paper, we explore the definition and use of safety contracts, identify challenges to component-based software reuse safety-critical systems, present examples to illustrate several key difficulties, and discuss potential solutions to these problems.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-6474-1; POD:978-1-4799-6475-8","10.1109/PRDC.2014.24","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6974780","based software engineering;contracts;modular safety case;safety;safety arguments","Contracts;Fuels;Safety;Sensors;Software;System analysis and design;Vehicles","object-oriented programming;safety-critical software;software reusability","component-based software reuse;safety contracts;safety-critical systems","","3","","46","","","","18-21 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many projects leverage the contribution of outsiders, and the sustainability of the project relies on retaining some of these newcomers. This research aims to identify the barriers that hinder newcomers' onboarding to OSS projects. Our method consisted of a qualitative study conducted with data obtained from four different sources: (i) systematic literature review; (ii) feedback from nine graduate and undergraduate students after they tried to join OSS projects; (iii) 24 responses to a questionnaire sent to 9 OSS projects; and (iv) semi-structured interviews with 36 subjects from 14 different projects, including newcomers and experienced members. The method to select the candidate papers in the systematic literature review was querying four digital libraries and backward snowballing. The data obtained from the practitioners from all three sources, and the primary studies obtained in the systematic review were analyzed using used procedures of Grounded Theory's open and axial coding. The analysis resulted in a conceptual model composed of 58 barriers, grouped into six different categories: cultural differences, newcomers' characteristics, reception issues, orientation, technical hurdles, and documentation problems. We could observe recurrent barriers evidenced in different data sources. We could notice that the onboarding process of a newcomer to an OSS can be a tough task. This research brings empirical support relying on data from different sources, organizes and discusses the existing common wisdom about barriers faced by newcomers to OSS projects, which deserve attention from researchers and OSS communities.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-4223-7; POD:978-1-4799-4221-3","10.1109/SBES.2014.9","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6943482","newcomers;onboarding;open source software;qualitative analysis;systematic literature review","Bibliographies;Communities;Documentation;Encoding;Interviews;Software;Systematics","digital libraries;project management;public domain software;query processing","backward snowballing;conceptual model;cultural differences;data sources;digital libraries;documentation problems;empirical barrier identification;experienced members;graduate student feedback;grounded theory axial coding;grounded theory open coding;newcomer OSS project onboarding;newcomer characteristics;open source software projects;orientation;outsider contribution;project sustainability;qualitative study;reception issues;recurrent barriers;semistructured interviews;systematic literature review;technical hurdles;undergraduate student feedback","","8","","44","","","","Sept. 28 2014-Oct. 3 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, little is known about these sketches and how they support design `in the moment', particularly in terms of the relationships among sketches, visual syntactic elements within sketches, and reasoning activities. To address this gap, we analyzed 14 hours of design activity by eight pairs of professional software designers, manually coding over 4000 events capturing the introduction of visual syntactic elements into sketches, focus transitions between sketches, and reasoning activities. Our findings indicate that sketches serve as a rich medium for supporting design conversations. Designers often use general-purpose notations. Designers introduce new syntactic elements to record aspects of the design, or re-purpose sketches as the design develops. Designers constantly shift focus between sketches, using groups of sketches together that contain complementary information. Finally, sketches play an important role in supporting several types of reasoning activities (mental simulation, review of progress, consideration of alternatives). But these activities often leave no trace and rarely lead to sketch creation.

Defect prediction models are typically built using classification or regression analysis on product and/or process metrics collected at a single point in time (e.g., a release date). However, current defect prediction models only predict if a defect will occur, but not when, which makes the prioritization of software quality improvements efforts difficult. To address this problem, Koru et al. applied survival analysis techniques to a large number of software systems to study how size (i.e., lines of code) influences the probability that a source code module (e.g., class or file) will experience a defect at any given time. Given that 1) the work of Koru et al. has been instrumental to our understanding of the size-defect relationship, 2) the use of survival analysis in the context of defect modelling has not been well studied and 3) replication studies are an important component of balanced scholarly debate, we present a replication study of the work by Koru et al. In particular, we present the details necessary to use survival analysis in the context of defect modelling (such details were missing from the original paper by Koru et al.). We also explore how differences between the traditional domains of survival analysis (i.e., medicine and epidemiology) and defect modelling impact our understanding of the size-defect relationship.

In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach that combines static and dynamic program analysis to audit buffer overflows. Using simple rules, test data are generated to automatically confirm some of the vulnerabilities through dynamic analysis and the remaining cases are predicted by mining static code attributes. Confirmed cases can be directly fixed without further verification whereas predicted cases need to be manually reviewed to confirm existence of vulnerabilities. Since our approach combines the strengths of static and dynamic analyses, it results in an overall accuracy improvement. In our evaluation of approach using the standard benchmark suite, our classifiers achieved a recall over 92% and precision greater than 81%. The dynamic analysis component confirmed 51% of known vulnerabilities along with reporting 2 new bugs, thereby reducing by half, otherwise needed manual auditing effort.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3575-8; POD:978-1-4799-3576-5","10.1109/COMPSAC.2014.62","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6899241","Vulnerability;auditing;buffer overflow;data mining;input validation;static and dynamic analysis;static code attributes","Accuracy;Arrays;Benchmark testing;Buffer overflows;Data mining;Input variables;Predictive models","data mining;program diagnostics","buffer overflow vulnerabilities;hybrid static-dynamic program analysis;static code attribute mining","","2","","8","","","","21-25 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Developing an algorithm to optimize communication amongst a group of spatially distributed sensor nodes in a WSN (Wireless Sensor Network) has been met with a number challenges due to the characterization of the sensor node device. These challenges include, but are not limited to: energy, memory, and throughput constraints. The traditional approach to overcome these challenges have emphasised the development of low power electronics, efficient modulation, coding, antenna design etc., it has been recognised that networking techniques can also have a strong impact on the energy efficiency of such systems. A variety of networking based approaches to energy efficiency are possible. One of the well-known approaches is to apply clustering techniques to effectively establish an ordered connection of sensor nodes whilst improving the overall network lifetime. This paper proposes an improved clustering based multicast approach that allows any cluster head to be a multicast source with an unlimited number of subscribers, to optimize group communication in WSNs whilst ensuring sensor nodes do not deprecate rapidly in energy levels. We review several clustering approaches and examine multicast versus broadcast communication in WSNs.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-2653-4; POD:978-1-4799-2654-1","10.1109/WAINA.2014.47","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6844643","Wireless Sensor Networks;clustering techniques;energy efficiency;multicast","Base stations;Multicast communication;Protocols;Reliability;Routing;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks","energy conservation;multicast communication;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication power management;wireless sensor networks","cluster head;clustering technique;energy efficiency;multicast routing;multicast source;network lifetime;on-demand routing;wireless sensor networks","","0","","38","","","","13-16 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Second, instead of building a distance field for the purpose of points-to-surface conversion directly, we pursue a first-order approach: the distance function is recovered from its gradient by a screened Poisson reconstruction, which is very resilient to noise and yet preserves high-frequency signal components. Our experiments show that the quality of metric reconstruction from structured light sensors is subject to systematic biases, and highlights the factors that influence it.

A programmer's time would primarily be spent on thinking about the algorithms and data structures, not on implementing them. To a degree, that used to be the case in the era of frequency scaling on a single core. However, due to power limitations, parallel programming has become necessary to obtain performance gains. But parallel architectures differ substantially from each other, often require specialized knowledge, and typically necessitate reimplementation and fine tuning of application code. These slow tasks frequently result in situations where most of the time is spent reimplementing old rather than writing new code. The goal of our research is to find new programming techniques that increase productivity, maintain high performance, and provide abstraction to free the programmer from these unnecessary and time-consuming tasks. However, such techniques usually come at the cost of substantial performance degradation. This paper investigates current approaches to portable accelerator programming, seeking to answer whether they make it possible to combine high efficiency with sufficient algorithm abstraction. It discusses OpenCL as a potential solution and presents three approaches of writing portable code: GPU-centric, CPU-centric and combined. By applying the three approaches to a real-world program, we show that it is at least sometimes possible to run exactly the same code on many different devices with minimal performance degradation using parameterization.

"Intermittent Electrical Contact Resistance as a Contributory Factor in the Loss of Automobile Speed Control Functional Integrity","A. F. Anderson","","IEEE Access","20140415","2014","2","","258","289","For three decades, sudden acceleration (SA) incidents have been reported, where automobiles accelerate without warning. These incidents are often diagnosed as no fault found. Investigators, who follow the line of diagnostic reasoning from the 1989 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) SA report, tend to conclude that SAs are caused by driver pedal error. This paper reviews the diagnostic process in the NHTSA report and finds that: 1) it assumes that an intermittent electronic malfunction should be reproducible either through in-vehicle or laboratory bench tests without saying why and 2) the consequence of this assumption, for which there appears to be no forensic precedent, is to recategorize possible intermittent electronic failures as proven to be nonelectronic. Showing that the supposedly inescapable conclusions of the NHTSA report concerning electronic malfunctions are without foundation opens the way for this paper to discuss electronic intermittency as a potential factor in SA incidents. It then reports a simple practical experiment that shows how mechanically induced electrical contact intermittencies can generate false speed signals that an automobile speed control system may accept as true and that do not trigger any diagnostic fault codes. Since the generation of accurate speed signals is essential for the proper functioning of a number of other automobile safety-critical control systems, the apparent ease with which false speed signals can be generated by vibration of a poor electrical contact is obviously a matter of general concern. Various ways of reducing the likelihood of SAs are discussed, including electrical contact improvements to reduce the likelihood of generating false speed signals, improved battery maintenance, and the incorporation of an independent fail-safe that reduces engine power in an emergency, such as a kill switch.","","","10.1109/ACCESS.2014.2313296","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6777269","Contact intermittency;No fault found;Sudden acceleration;cruise control;diagnostic reasoning;electronic speed control;electronic throttle control;functional safety;speed sensor;sudden acceleration","Acceleration;Automotive electronics;Electric contact resistance;Engines;Fault diagnosis;Velocity control","automobiles;automotive electronics;electrical contacts;road safety;velocimeters;velocity control","1989 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration;NHTSA;automobile safety-critical control system;automobile speed control functional integrity loss;intermittent electrical contact resistance;intermittent electronic malfunction;speed sensor;sudden acceleration incidents","","3","","53","","","20140321","2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

"Flow-level models for capacity planning and management in interference-coupled wireless data networks","A. Fehske; H. Klessig; J. Voigt; G. Fettweis","","IEEE Communications Magazine","20140212","2014","52","2","164","171","In 4G cellular networks, both the adaptation of data rates to current interference conditions due to adaptive modulation and coding as well as a frequency reuse of one mandate precise techniques to estimate cell capacities and cell loads in order to accurately predict the quality of service delivered to end users. Such estimation happens ideally already during the network planning phase and is further required for self-optimization at runtime. Classic flow-level techniques to estimate cell loads, capacities, and related quality of service metrics assume static and worst case interference, which is analytically simple, but may produce considerable errors and lead to disadvantageous planning and optimization results. Appropriate models where individual cells are coupled through interference are rendered analytically intractable. This article first introduces basic flow-level modeling techniques and then reviews recent results in the field of flow-level network models, which allow the actual loads and capacities in interference- coupled wireless networks to be bound and closely approximated. We discuss trade-offs between accuracy and numerical complexity of different techniques and identify a model based on the notion of average interference as the most practically relevant. Simulation results for a large scenario based on a real network illustrate its applicability to practical network planning.","0163-6804;01636804","","10.1109/MCOM.2014.6736758","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6736758","","Complexity theory;Computational modeling;Interference;Load modeling;Numerical models;Signal to noise ratio;Telecommunication network management","adaptive modulation;cellular radio;frequency allocation;quality of service;radiofrequency interference;telecommunication network planning","4G cellular networks;adaptive coding;adaptive modulation;average interference;capacity planning;flow level modeling techniques;flow level models;frequency reuse;interference coupled wireless data networks;interference coupled wireless networks;network planning;quality of service","","6","","10","","","","February 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

One of the most serious and dangerous web application vulnerabilities is SQL injection. SQL injection attack took place by inserting a portion of malicious SQL query through a non-validated input from the user into the legitimate query statement. Consequently database management system will execute these commands and it leads to SQL injection. A successful SQL injection attack interfere Confidentiality, Integrity and availability of information in the database. Based on the statistical researches this type of attack had a high impact on business. Finding the proper solution to stop or mitigate the SQL injection is necessary. To address this problem security researchers introduce different techniques to develop secure codes, prevent SQL injection attacks and detect them. In this paper we present a comprehensive review of different types of SQL injection detection and prevention techniques. We criticize strengths and weaknesses of each technique. Such a structural classification would further help other researchers to choose the right technique for the further studies.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-5133-3; POD:978-1-4799-3702-8","10.1109/ICICM.2013.18","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6702782","Information security;SQL injection;Web application vulnerability","Browsers;Conferences;Context;Databases;Runtime;Security;Testing","Internet;SQL;query processing;security of data","Internet;SQL injection attacks;SQL injection detection technique;SQL injection prevention technique;database management system;legitimate query statement;malicious SQL query;statistical researches;structural classification","","7","","17","","","","4-6 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"From the Virtual to the Material: The re-Appearance of the Art Object","D. Harrison","Sch. of Art & Design, Univ. of Wolverhampton, Wolverhampton, UK","2013 International Conference on Cyberworlds","20131212","2013","","","226","231","Artists, designers and craft makers are currently exploring new materials and processes such as 'Accumulated Printing' within their practice to bring forth new forms and extend ideas. Often this is through a hybrid dialogic process of a maker's thoughts translated into code in the virtual world for production in the real world. Resulting in unique crafted objects created without the 'touch' of the hand-made, while encapsulating craft-thinking in the machine-made. This real-virtual-real approach is further streamlined, and without the craft signature, when working in shared virtual space. As artists are moving objects across the virtual from the real and back into solid form, so cyberspace gains a foothold in the real through materialisation and a return to the virtual. The second life platform is relatively new and still under development, but there are a number of artists beginning to explore the possibilities of this virtual world outside its commercial premise. The phenomena of the re-materialisation of the art object will be presented through the shift in art-thinking since mid-last century, as evidenced by Lucy Lippard and derived from the impact of earlier art. The paper will review the current situation via contemporary understandings, and where new technologies have allowed for a re-materialisation of the art object, exampling the work of artists such as Intersculpt, Michael Eden and those in the Kritical Works in SL II exhibition. This re-positioning of the art object allows a return to the initial formative conceptual framework, and offers a way through to a cutting-edge form of post conceptual art practice.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-2246-8; POD:978-1-4799-2247-5","10.1109/CW.2013.81","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6680119","Conceptual Art;Readymades;art object;dematerialisation;digital technologies;rematerialisation","Art;Green products;Internet;Painting;Production;Solids","art","accumulated printing;art object;craft-thinking;hybrid dialogic process;initial formative conceptual framework;re-appearance;re-materialisation;real-virtual-real approach;second life platform;unique crafted objects;virtual world","","0","","19","","","","21-23 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Ever more diverse paradigms for expressing parallelism and synchronization become available while their influence on usability and performance remains largely unclear. This paper describes an experiment comparing four markedly different approaches to parallel programming: Chapel, Cilk, Go, and Threading Building Blocks (TBB). Each language is used to implement sequential and parallel versions of six benchmark programs. The implementations are then reviewed by notable experts in the language, thereby obtaining reference versions for each language and benchmark. The resulting pool of 96 implementations is used to compare the languages with respect to source code size, coding time, execution time, and speedup. The experiment uncovers strengths and weaknesses in all approaches, facilitating an informed selection of a language under a particular set of requirements. The expert review step furthermore highlights the importance of expert knowledge when using modern parallel programming approaches.","1949-3770;19493770","Electronic:978-0-7695-5056-5; POD:978-1-4799-1144-8","10.1109/ESEM.2013.10","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6681351","","Benchmark testing;Measurement;Multicore processing;Parallel processing;Parallel programming;Usability","benchmark testing;multiprocessing systems;parallel programming;programming languages;software libraries","Chapel;Cilk;Go;TBB;benchmarking usability;coding time;execution time;expert knowledge;libraries;multicore computing;multicore languages;parallel benchmark programs;parallel programming;parallelism;programming languages;sequential benchmark programs;source code size;synchronization;threading building blocks","","12","","24","","","","10-11 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We performed a systematic mapping study to determine which techniques and metrics have been empirically evaluated. A review protocol was developed and followed to identify 30 primary studies with empirical evidence of code decay. We categorized detection techniques into two broad groups: human-based and metric-based approaches. We describe the attributes of each approach and distinguish features of several subcategories of both high-level groups. A tabular overview of code decay metrics is also presented. We exclude studies that do not use time (i.e., do not use evaluation of multiple software versions) as a factor when evaluating code decay. This limitation serves to focus the review. We found that coupling metrics are the most widely used at identifying code decay. Researchers use various terms to define code decay, and we recommend additional research to operationalize the terms to provide more consistent analysis.","1095-1350;10951350","Electronic:978-1-4799-2931-3; POD:978-1-4799-2932-0","10.1109/WCRE.2013.6671309","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6671309","Architecture Violations;Code Decay;Coupling;Design Rules;Metrics;Software Evolution","Computer architecture;Conferences;Data mining;History;Measurement;Software;Systematics","software metrics;software quality","code decay detection;code decay metrics;coupling metrics;human-based approach;metric-based approach;software system quality;systematic mapping;trusted measurement techniques","","2","","48","","","","14-17 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The results of our study suggest that experienced programmers make suggestions that can introduce new programming constructs to novice programmers. The participants in our study most commonly made suggestions that improve the code quality of novice programs, rather than changing their output. Furthermore, experienced programmers could often state a simple heuristic rule to use in identifying other novice programs that would benefit from their suggestion. Participants were able to author the rules in pseudocode, mostly using combinations of iteration and comparison to find patterns of problematic code. However, based on a test implementation of a selected set of rules for these suggestions, we conclude that support for improving rules through review and community input will be valuable.","1943-6092;19436092","Electronic:978-1-4799-0369-6; POD:978-1-4799-0370-2; USB:978-1-4799-0368-9","10.1109/VLHCC.2013.6645259","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6645259","crowdsourcing;independent learning;novice programming;static code analysis","Animation;Educational institutions;Glass;Programming profession;Standards","program diagnostics","crowdsourcing;expert programmers;heuristic rule;novice programmers;program identification;pseudocode;static code analysis","","4","","53","","","","15-19 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The first generation was coded from an unorganized collection of requirements that were reviewed infrequently and informally. In contrast, the second was developed based on a set of requirements stored in a Requirements Management database and formally reviewed at each revision. Quality indicators for the second software product all improved dramatically even with the increased complexity of the newer product. This paper will recap that study and then present data from a subsequent Intel case study revealing that quality enhancements continued on the third generation of the product. The third generation software was designed and coded using the final set of requirements from the second version as a starting point. Key product differentiators included changes to operate with a new Intel processor, the introduction of new hardware platforms and the addition of approximately fifty new features. Software development methodologies were nearly identical, with only the change to a continuous build process for source code check-in added. Despite the enhanced functionality and complexity in the third generation software, requirements defects, software defects, software sightings, feature commit vs. delivery (feature variance), defect closure efficiency rates, and number of days from project commit to customer release all improved from the second to the third generation of the software.","1090-705X;1090705X","Electronic:978-1-4673-5765-4; POD:978-1-4673-5763-0","10.1109/RE.2013.6636731","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6636731","Requirements specification;multi-generational software products;requirements defects;reviews;software defects;software quality","Complexity theory;Indexes;Mobile communication;Software;Stability analysis;Testing;Writing","formal specification;product development;software quality;software reliability","Intel processor;Intel product;delivery defect closure efficiency rates;feature commit;feature commit rates;feature variance;hardware platforms;product differentiators;product generation;quality enhancements;requirements defects;requirements management database;software defects;software development methodologies;software product;software quality indicators;software sightings;source code;third generation software coding;third generation software design","","2","","10","","","","15-19 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our goal is to reflect on a meta-level about evaluation in our community through a systematic understanding of the characteristics and goals of presented evaluations. For this purpose we conducted a systematic review of ten years of evaluations in the published papers using and extending a coding scheme previously established by Lam et al. [2012]. The results of our review include an overview of the most common evaluation goals in the community, how they evolved over time, and how they contrast or align to those of the IEEE Information Visualization conference. In particular, we found that evaluations specific to assessing resulting images and algorithm performance are the most prevalent (with consistently 80-90% of all papers since 1997). However, especially over the last six years there is a steady increase in evaluation methods that include participants, either by evaluating their performances and subjective feedback or by evaluating their work practices and their improved analysis and reasoning capabilities using visual tools. Up to 2010, this trend in the IEEE Visualization conference was much more pronounced than in the IEEE Information Visualization conference which only showed an increasing percentage of evaluation through user performance and experience testing. Since 2011, however, also papers in IEEE Information Visualization show such an increase of evaluations of work practices and analysis as well as reasoning using visual tools. Further, we found that generally the studies reporting requirements analyses and domain-specific work practices are too informally reported which hinders cross-comparison and lowers external validity.","1077-2626;10772626","","10.1109/TVCG.2013.126","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6634108","Data visualization;Encoding;Evaluation;History;Mathematical model;Systematics;information visualization;scientific visualization;systematic review;validation;visualization","Data visualization;Encoding;History;Mathematical model;Systematics","data visualisation;encoding","IEEE information visualization;IEEE visualization conference;coding scheme;domain-specific work practices;meta-level;requirements analyses;visual tools;visualization evaluation","Algorithms;Computer Graphics;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Information Storage and Retrieval;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;User-Computer Interface","46","","74","","","","Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Finding all edit locations and editing them correctly is tedious and error-prone. In this paper, we demonstrate an Eclipse plug-in called Lase that (1) creates context-aware edit scripts from two or more examples, and uses these scripts to (2) automatically identify edit locations and (3) transform the code. In Lase, users can view syntactic edit operations and corresponding context for each input example. They can also choose a different subset of the examples to adjust the abstraction level of inferred edits.

This includes identifying possible attacks or threat scenarios that target the system and may result in breaching of system security. Additionally we may also assess the strength of the system and its security architecture using well-known security metrics such as system attack surface, Compartmentalization, least-privilege, etc. However, existing efforts are limited to specific, predefined security properties or scenarios that are checked either manually or using limited toolsets. We introduce a new approach to support architecture security analysis using security scenarios and metrics. Our approach is based on formalizing attack scenarios and security metrics signature specification using the Object Constraint Language (OCL). Using formal signatures we analyse a target system to locate signature matches (for attack scenarios), or to take measurements (for security metrics). New scenarios and metrics can be incorporated and calculated provided that a formal signature can be specified. Our approach supports defining security metrics and scenarios at architecture, design, and code levels. We have developed a prototype software system architecture security analysis tool. To the best of our knowledge this is the first extensible architecture security risk analysis tool that supports both metric-based and scenario-based architecture security analysis. We have validated our approach by using it to capture and evaluate signatures from the NIST security principals and attack scenarios defined in the CAPEC database.","0270-5257;02705257","Electronic:978-1-4673-3076-3; POD:978-1-4673-3075-6","10.1109/ICSE.2013.6606612","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6606612","Architecture Security Risk analysis;Common attack patterns enumeration and classification (CAPEC);Formal attack patterns specification;Software security","Computer architecture;Measurement;Risk analysis;Security;Software;Software architecture;Unified modeling language","digital signatures;object-oriented languages;software architecture;software metrics","CAPEC database;NIST security principals;OCL;automated software architecture security risk analysis;formal signatures;formalized signatures;metric-based architecture security analysis;object constraint language;scenario-based architecture security analysis;secure software development lifecycles;security architecture;security flaws;security metrics signature specification;signature matches;system development;system security","","12","","25","","","","18-26 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is widely recognized that Exascale systems will be constrained by power. The Mont-Blanc project aims to build an alternative approach towards Exascale based on aggregating parts from the embedded and mobile market, which offer a better FLOPS/Watt ratio and a lower unit cost, at the expense of lower peak performance per chip. HPC systems built from these parts will require a higher number of processors, or resort to extensive use of compute accelerators. Using a higher number of chips increases the available memory bandwidth, alleviating the bandwidth wall, but increases the pressure on the interconnection network. The use of a high number of processors and accelerators, and the increased pressure on the interconnect require extensive code optimizations to achieve strong scaling, point to point synchronizations, and overlap data transfer with computation. The role of the OmpSs parallel programming model is paramount, as the key enabling technology that hides the complexity from the programmer, and transparently performs all the required optimizations. In this talk, we will review the design philosophies of several vendors, including HPC compute accelerators, and ARM-based mobile application processors in terms of peak performance, memory bandwidth, and energy efficiency; and we will review how the OmpSs programming models exploits the benefits of the Mont-Blanc approach while overcoming the drawbacks.","1550-4808;15504808","Electronic:978-0-7695-5035-0; POD:978-1-4799-0376-4","10.1109/ACSD.2013.37","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6598334","","","mobile computing;parallel programming","ARM-based mobile application processor;Exascale systems;FLOPS-Watt ratio;HPC system;Mont-Blanc project;OmpSs parallel programming model;code optimization;compute accelerator;energy efficiency;high performance computer;interconnection network;overlap data transfer;point to point synchronization","","0","","","","","","8-10 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

I will review the processes related to the ecology of stellar clusters, discuss the numerical hurdles and the physical principles. In addition, I will introduce the AMUSE framework with which we are performing simulations of the ecology of stellar clusters. AMUSE is a general purpose framework for interconnecting existing scientific software with a homogeneous and unified interface. Since the framework is based on the standard message passing interface, any production ready code that is written in a language that supports its native bindings can be incorporated; in addition, our framework is intrinsically parallel and it conveniently separates all the numerical solvers in memory. The strict separation also enables the possibility to realize unit conversion between the different modules and to recover from fatalities in a unified and structured way. The time spent in the framework is relatively small, and for production simulations we measured an overhead of at most 10%, which in our case is acceptable. Due to the unified structure of the interface, incorporating new modules which address the same physics is relatively straightforward. The time stepping between the codes can be simply consecutive or realized via a mixed variable symplectic method in which the Hamiltonian of the problem is solved in separate steps and combined via a Verlet-leapfrog integration scheme. In our experience with an implementation for multiphysics simulations in astrophysics, we encounter relatively few problems with the strict separation in methods, and the results of our test simulations are consistent with earlier results that use a monolithic framework.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4996-5; POD:978-1-4673-6465-2","10.1109/CCGrid.2013.113","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6546093","","Abstracts;Cloud computing;Grid computing","astronomy computing;astrophysical fluid dynamics;gravitation;message passing;parallel processing;star clusters","AMUSE framework;Verlet-leapfrog integration scheme;astronomical multipurpose software environment;astrophysics;background potential dynamics;code time stepping;complex nonlinear evolution;gravitational dynamics;homogeneous interface;hydrodynamcs;message passing interface;mixed variable symplectic method;multiphysics simulation;numerical solver;parallel framework;parent galaxy;problem Hamiltonian;production simulation;scientific software;self gravitating stellar system;star cluster ecology;stellar cluster ecology simulation;stellar evolution;unified interface","","0","","","","","","13-16 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Having small repair locality is desirable, since it is proportional to the number of disk accesses during repair. However, recent publications show that small repair locality comes with a penalty in terms of code distance or storage overhead if exact repair is required. Here, we first review some of the main results on storage codes under various repair regimes and discuss the recent work on possible (information-theoretical) trade-offs between repair locality and other code parameters like storage overhead and code distance, under the exact repair regime. Then we present some new information theoretical lower bounds on the storage overhead as a function of the repair locality, valid for all common coding and repair models. In particular, we show that if each of the n nodes in a distributed storage system has storage capacity a and if, at any time, a failed node can be functionally repaired by contacting some set of r nodes (which may depend on the actual state of the system) and downloading an amount β of data from each, then in the extreme cases where α = β or a = r β, the maximal coding rate is at most r/(r + 1) or 1/2, respectively (that is, the excess storage overhead is at least 1/r or 1, respectively).","","Electronic:978-1-4673-5288-8; POD:978-1-4673-5287-1; USB:978-1-4673-5286-4","10.1109/ICCNC.2013.6504196","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6504196","","Bandwidth;Bismuth;Encoding;Maintenance engineering;Peer-to-peer computing;Reliability;Vectors","codes;maintenance engineering","distributed storage code overhead distance system;failed node repair locality;information-theoretic;maximal coding rate","","11","","30","","","","28-31 Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

First, the best effort nature of the Internet exposes media packets to variable bandwidth, loss, and delay as they traverse the network. Second, the prediction dependencies employed to maximize compression efficiency make the reconstruction process at the client extremely vulnerable to missing data. Third, the heterogeneity of client devices in terms of computing power, display capabilities, and access link capacity necessitates customizing the streaming process per user. My article reviews existing opportunities for addressing these challenges from within each of the three main stages of the content delivery pipeline (i.e., encoding, transmission, and reconstruction). Concretely, I first describe adaptive source coding techniques that construct a compressed representation of the multiview video source that exhibits resilience to network bandwidth variations and client view selection uncertainty. Then I discuss intelligent methods for error protection, caching, and packet scheduling that organize the transmission of multiview data in a bandwidth-effective way. Here, I also review prospective multipath and cloud-assisted techniques for multiview video streaming. Finally, I identify robust client-side content reconstruction schemes and adaptive media playout methods that can minimize the impact of missing data and enhance the user's interactive experience. Then I proceed to describe community-driven streaming techniques for delivering interactive multiview content over a population of social peers. The article concludes with an outline of approaches for synergistic exploitation of the techniques I will present theretofore, jointly across the different layers of the network protocol stack at which they individually operate. Here, I also highlight the main deployment challenges for some of these techniques, and how their design should be addressed accordingly, to overcome them.","0163-6804;01636804","","10.1109/MCOM.2013.6515052","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6515052","","Bandwidth;Decoding;Encoding;Internet;Packet radio networks;Peer-to-peer computing;Streaming media","adaptive codes;data compression;protocols;source coding;video coding;video streaming","access link capacity;adaptive media playout methods;adaptive multiview video streaming;adaptive source coding techniques;compressed representation;compression efficiency;computing power;content delivery pipeline;display capabilities;encoding;error protection;intelligent methods;interactive multiview content;media packets;multiview video content;multiview video source;network bandwidth;network protocol;packet networks;reconstruction;reconstruction process;robust client-side content reconstruction schemes;transmission","","18","","18","","","","May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we present an extensive review and tutorial on quantum search algorithms (QSA) and their potential applications, and we employ a QSA that finds the minimum of a function in order to perform optimal hard MUD with a quadratic reduction in the computational complexity when compared to that of the ML MUD. Furthermore, we follow a quantum approach to achieve the same performance as the optimal soft-input soft-output classic detectors by replacing them with a quantum algorithm, which estimates the weighted sum of a function's evaluations. We propose a soft-input soft-output quantum-assisted MUD (QMUD) scheme, which is the quantum-domain equivalent of the ML MUD. We then demonstrate its application using the design example of a direct-sequence code division multiple access system employing bit-interleaved coded modulation relying on iterative decoding, and compare it with the optimal ML MUD in terms of its performance and complexity. Both our extrinsic information transfer charts and bit error ratio curves show that the performance of the proposed QMUD and that of the optimal classic MUD are equivalent, but the QMUD's computational complexity is significantly lower.","","","10.1109/ACCESS.2013.2259536","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6515077","BBHT quantum search algorithm;Bit-interleaved coded modulation;Dürr–Høyer algorithm;EXIT chart;Grover's quantum search algorithm;computational complexity;iterative decoding;multi-user detection;quantum amplitude amplification;quantum amplitude estimation;quantum computation;quantum entanglement;quantum mean algorithm","Algorithm design and analysis;Amplitude modulation;Computational complexity;Interleaved codes;Maximum likelihood decoding;Modulation;Parallel processing;Quantum computing;Search methods","code division multiple access;communication complexity;iterative decoding;maximum likelihood decoding;quantum computing","ML MUD;QMUD scheme;QSA;bit-interleaved coded modulation;computational complexity;direct-sequence code division multiple access system;iterative decoding;low complexity maximum likelihood iterative quantum multiuser detector design;optimal soft-input soft-output classic detectors;quantum search algorithms;quantum wireless;soft-input soft-output quantum-assisted MUD scheme","","24","","102","","","","2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

These stencil-based programs form a class of algorithms found at the heart of many computer simulations and PDE solvers. Many stencil codes are memory bound, meaning that their performance depends heavily on an efficient usage of the computers' memory subsystem. This work's contribution is to give an extensive review of the available implementation alternatives and to put them in context with the state of the art.

The wavelet transform is more and more widely used in image processing algorithms. In this paper, we reviewed the different methods of image coding. We reviewed the different methods in terms of PSNR [Peak Signal to Noise Ratio] and MSE [Mean Square Error] which can be used to better understand the relationship between various methods and their features.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4669-0; POD:978-1-4673-5693-0","10.1109/ICCCNT.2012.6396077","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6396077","ASWDR;EZW;LSK;LZW;NLS;SPECK;SPIHT","Biomedical imaging;Encoding;Image coding;Image resolution;Indexes;PSNR;Partitioning algorithms","data compression;image coding;mean square error methods;wavelet transforms","MSE;PSNR;digital information retrieval;digital information storage;image coding;image compression method;mean square error;peak signal to noise ratio;wavelet transform","","0","","17","","","","26-28 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The transform coding utilizing the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) has been commonly adopted in the various standards for image compression. These include the CCITT standard for video telephony, the JPEG (Joint Photographic Expert Group) standard for coloured still-image transmission and the MPEG (Motion Pictures Expert Group) standard for pictures on the storage media. MPEG was originally developed for digital television, its popularity and effectiveness as a storage/transmission format and abundance of content have made it attractive for use in personal video playback devices. DCT based coding schemes are also used for higher quality applications such as HDTV. Therefore, an architecture which rapidly computes DCT has become a key component of image compression VLSIs. This paper reviews the existing efficient algorithms for implementing the reconfigurable Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)/ Inverse Discrete Cosine Transform (IDCT) architecture for multimedia applications and proposed an algorithm which offers high speed and reduced area. The proposed architecture uses an error compensated adder tree to perform shifting and addition operations. The reconfigurable architecture not only decreases the time of research and development but also saves fabrication cost. The advantages of the proposed architecture are that this architecture does not require multipliers and ROM. It only needs adders and shifters. In digital circuits, the area of the multipliers and ROM are larger than adders and shifters.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4669-0; POD:978-1-4673-5693-0","10.1109/ICCCNT.2012.6396054","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6396054","Discrete Cosine Transform;Inverse Discrete Cosine Transform;VLSI;reconfigurable architecture","Codecs;Computer architecture;Discrete cosine transforms;Encoding;Image coding;Transform coding;Very large scale integration","data compression;digital signal processing chips;discrete cosine transforms;image colour analysis;transform coding;video codecs;video coding","CCITT standard;HDTV;JPEG;Joint Photographic Expert Group standard;MPEG;Motion Pictures Expert Group standard;ROM;VLSI;addition operation;coloured still-image transmission;digital circuit;digital television;error compensated adder tree;fabrication cost;image compression;inverse discrete cosine transform architecture;multimedia application;multiplier;personal video playback device;reconfigurable DCT architecture;reconfigurable IDCT architecture;reconfigurable architecture;reconfigurable discrete cosine transform;shifter;shifting operation;storage format;transform coding;transform technique;transmission format;video codec;video telephony","","0","","13","","","","26-28 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The work presents an approach for the automatic detection and visualization of code smells and discusses how this approach could be used in the design of a software inspection tool. The feasibility of the proposed approach was illustrated with the development of jCOSMO, a prototype code smell browser that detects and visualizes code smells in JAVA source code. It was the first tool to automatically detect code smells in source code, and we demonstrated the application of this tool in an industrial quality assessment case study. In addition to reviewing the WCRE 2002 work, we will discuss subsequent developments in this area by looking at a selection of papers that were published in its wake. In particular, we will have a look at recent related work in which we empirically investigated the relation between code smells and software maintainability in a longitudinal study where professional developers were observed while maintaining four different software systems that exhibited known code smells.

Ubayashi","Kyushu University, Fukuoka","IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","20130523","2013","39","6","757","773","Defect prediction models are a well-known technique for identifying defect-prone files or packages such that practitioners can allocate their quality assurance efforts (e.g., testing and code reviews). However, once the critical files or packages have been identified, developers still need to spend considerable time drilling down to the functions or even code snippets that should be reviewed or tested. This makes the approach too time consuming and impractical for large software systems. Instead, we consider defect prediction models that focus on identifying defect-prone (“risky”) software changes instead of files or packages. We refer to this type of quality assurance activity as “Just-In-Time Quality Assurance,” because developers can review and test these risky changes while they are still fresh in their minds (i.e., at check-in time). To build a change risk model, we use a wide range of factors based on the characteristics of a software change, such as the number of added lines, and developer experience. A large-scale study of six open source and five commercial projects from multiple domains shows that our models can predict whether or not a change will lead to a defect with an average accuracy of 68 percent and an average recall of 64 percent. Furthermore, when considering the effort needed to review changes, we find that using only 20 percent of the effort it would take to inspect all changes, we can identify 35 percent of all defect-inducing changes. Our findings indicate that “Just-In-Time Quality Assurance” may provide an effort-reducing way to focus on the most risky changes and thus reduce the costs of developing high-quality software.","0098-5589;00985589","","10.1109/TSE.2012.70","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6341763","Maintenance;defect prediction;just-in-time prediction;mining software repositories;software metrics","Accuracy;Entropy;Measurement;Object oriented modeling;Predictive models;Quality assurance;Software","program testing;software maintenance;software metrics;software quality","commercial projects;cost reduction;defect prediction models;defect-prone file identification;defect-prone package identification;defect-prone software change identification;just-in-time quality assurance;open source projects;risk model;risky changes;software metrics;software quality assurance activities;software repository mining;software systems;source code inspection;unit testing","","45","1","63","","","20121110","June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To demonstrate, particularly to a certification authority, that sufficient testing has been performed, it is necessary to achieve the test coverage levels recommended or mandated by safety standards and industry guidelines. Mutation testing provides an alternative or complementary method of measuring test sufficiency, but has not been widely adopted in the safety-critical industry. In this study, we provide an empirical evaluation of the application of mutation testing to airborne software systems which have already satisfied the coverage requirements for certification. Specifically, we apply mutation testing to safety-critical software developed using high-integrity subsets of C and Ada, identify the most effective mutant types, and analyze the root causes of failures in test cases. Our findings show how mutation testing could be effective where traditional structural coverage analysis and manual peer review have failed. They also show that several testing issues have origins beyond the test activity, and this suggests improvements to the requirements definition and coding process. Our study also examines the relationship between program characteristics and mutation survival and considers how program size can provide a means for targeting test areas most likely to have dormant faults. Industry feedback is also provided, particularly on how mutation testing can be integrated into a typical verification life cycle of airborne software.","0098-5589;00985589","","10.1109/TSE.2012.56","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6298894","Mutation;certification;safety-critical software;testing;verification","Certification;Guidelines;Industries;Safety;Software systems;Testing","Ada;C language;aerospace computing;certification;integrated software;program testing;program verification;safety-critical software;software quality","Ada;C;airborne software system;certification;coding process;coverage requirement satisfaction;empirical evaluation;industry guideline;mutant type;mutation testing;safety standard;safety-critical software;software failure;software integration;software test quality;structural coverage analysis;test coverage level;test sufficiency measurement;verification life cycle","","9","","41","","","20120911","June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper we extend this to App-icons and propose a complete system for automatic icon-scanning: it first detects the icon in a snapshot and then recognizes it. Icon scanning is a highly challenging problem due to the large variety of icons (~500K in App-Store) and background wallpapers. In addition, our system should further deal with the challenges introduced by taking pictures of a screen. Nevertheless, the novel solution proposed in this paper provides high detection and recognition rates.

We applied our approach to the 32,108 non-zero priced apps available in the Blackberry app store in September 2011. Our results show that there is a strong correlation between customer rating and the rank of app downloads, though perhaps surprisingly, there is no correlation between price and downloads, nor between price and rating.

When changing software, impact analysis and regression testing are required to preserve the quality of the system. However, without a consistent classification of types of change operations, a well-founded impact analysis methodology cannot be developed. Existing works which analyze and apply change types are typically limited to a certain aspect of software, e.g. source code or architecture. They also lack a thorough investigation of change types, which lead to duplicated proposals and the absence of a consistent taxonomy. In this paper, we review the usage of change types for impact analysis and regression testing, and illustrate how both activities are affected by different types of changes. Therefore, we outline how existing work deals with different types and granularities of changes. Our main contribution is a generic, graph-based description of changes which distinguishes between atomic and composite change types. We show how existing change types and classifications can be mapped onto our proposed approach and change taxonomy. Finally, we illustrate how our proposed change types can support real developer activities, such as refactorings, impact analysis, and regression testing.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4664-3; POD:978-1-4673-0912-7","10.1109/ECBS.2012.9","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6195175","change types;graphs;impact analysis;regression testing;software evolution","","","","","3","","41","","","","11-13 April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For portable products, power reduction in memories with DRAM-like cells can be done by reducing the refresh frequency, but the loss of data integrity should be taken care of seriously. To solve these issues, we have proposed a parallel encoding and decoding ECC scheme to reduce refresh power for an industrial pseudo-SRAM (PSRAM) with long codewords. In this paper, we briefly review the scheme and propose a systematic way to generate the parity check matrix for the new ECC scheme. We also modify the parity correction mechanism to reduce the operating power of the scheme. As for the 70 ns access time of the 256-MB PSRAM with 64-bit codewords and 16-bit I/O, experimental results show that the new ECC scheme can be integrated with the READ/WRITE operations with about 0.2 percent circuit area overhead and less than 3.5 ns encoding/decoding time. The new ECC architecture provides a flexible solution for memories with different widths of ECC codewords and I/O ports, without the error masking effect or reduction in reliability.","0018-9340;00189340","","10.1109/TC.2012.98","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6189334","DRAM chips;DRAM-like cell;Decision support systems;Decoding;ECC methodology;Encoding;Error control codes (ECCs);Error correction codes;Handheld computers;Reliability;SRAM chips;Systematics;error control code;fault tolerance;industrial pseudo-SRAM;low power PSRAM;low-power design;low-power electronics;memory size 256 MByte;parallel decoding;parallel encoding;parity check matrix;parity correction mechanism;portable product;power reduction;pseudo-SRAM;reliability;word length 16 bit;word length 64 bit","Decision support systems;Decoding;Encoding;Error correction codes;Handheld computers;Reliability;Systematics","DRAM chips;SRAM chips;low-power electronics;reliability","DRAM-like cell;ECC methodology;error control code;industrial pseudo-SRAM;low power PSRAM;memory size 256 MByte;parallel decoding;parallel encoding;parity check matrix;parity correction mechanism;portable product;power reduction;reliability;word length 16 bit;word length 64 bit","","1","1","20","","","20120424","July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
"Automated program transformation for migration to new libraries","V. Itsykson; A.

This task may be accomplished manually, but this will certainly be not cost- and time-effective and will require additional testing and verification. Therefore various automated techniques aimed to solve this problem seem to be very useful. The article takes into consideration one of such approaches, mainly focused on transferring source code between two library environments. A comprehensive review of related works is presented. The classification of typical library entities having strong impact to software characteristics is defined. Special program annotation language (PanLang) is introduced. The main purpose of this language is to specify library structure and behavior. The key feature of PanLang is the high level of abstraction allowing to take out of consideration the library implementation details. Therefore, PanLang annotation applied to a library is a partial specification. Such a specification may be considered as a Moore FSM. The problem of semantic conformance of source and target libraries' specifications is posed. The conformance is guaranteed if set of execution traces corresponding to source library may be represented as a subset of target's one. In our case the solution of this problem may be reduced to FSM homomorphism detection. Our approach considers using Abstract Semantic Graph (ASG) as a model of source code. Therefore after semantic conformance is proved, special transformation rules may be applied ASG. These rules are based on both source and target partial specifications which guarantee correctness of result software. A simple prototype migration tool based on proposed approach is described. This Java-based tool uses CLang frontend to LLVM for C source code parsing and ASG construction. A number of sample migration tasks were used to pro- e the method correctness and efficiency. Possible improvements and future researches are also discussed.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-0844-1; POD:978-1-4673-0843-4; USB:978-1-4673-0842-7","10.1109/CEE-SECR.2011.6188463","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6188463","function behavior semantic;library's environment;program transformation;reengineering;software migration;specification of library","Automation;Libraries;Linux;Operating systems;Semantics;Sockets","Java;formal specification;grammars;graph theory;program diagnostics;software libraries","ASG construction;C source code parsing;CLang;FSM homomorphism detection;Java-based tool;LLVM;Linux;Moore FSM;PanLang;Windows;abstract semantic graph;automated program transformation;desktop PC;execution traces;library behavior specification;library entity classification;library environments;library structure specification;mobile platform;program annotation language;semantic conformance;software engineering;software migration task;source code model;source code transfer;source library;transformation rules","","0","","13","","","","Oct. 31 2011-Nov. 3 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Looks Good To Me (LGTM) is a means to stamp an 'ok' on code reviews and then have the code moved to production. One key part of this process is a detailed quality analysis by checking code, looking for potential known bugs, and evaluating the design. As code bases are changed almost every day by many developers, we need to devise means for effective, regular, and focused analysis. In the recent past we have looked into approaches of software sensing and bug smelling. Sensing software is employed by audio-visual and multi-touch interfaces to a code base and its change history. Bug smelling leverages bug prediction on the levels of classes, methods, or change types. Combining both can lead to a more effective quality analysis for reviewing tasks such that the signing off by LGTM is facilitated. In this talk we will present approaches and tools such as SmellTagger or Coco Viz for software sensing and bug smelling. We will also discuss current limitations and potential new horizons for software evolution research.","1534-5351;15345351","Electronic:978-0-7695-4666-7; POD:978-1-4673-0984-4","10.1109/CSMR.2012.9","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6178870","","Informatics;Sensors;Software;Software engineering","program debugging;software maintenance;user interfaces","Coco Viz;LGTM;SmellTagger;audio-visual interfaces;bug prediction;bug smelling;code checking;design evaluation;looks good to me;multitouch interfaces;quality analysis;software evolution research;software sensing","","0","","","","","","27-30 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We then elaborate on converged optical fiber-wireless access networks, which may be viewed as the endgame of broadband access, and explain the inherent coverage and QoS issues of conventional radio-over-fiber networks for distributed wireless MAC protocols and how their limitations can be avoided in so-called radio-and-fiber networks. We explore powerful layer-2 optical-wireless, hierarchical frame aggregation, and network coding techniques that significantly improve the throughput-delay performance, resource utilization efficiency, and survivability of NG-PON and FiWi networks.

Facilitation may assist in that process because it encourages information sharing in order to promote effective teamwork. To aid in online team communications, a virtual facilitator has been developed. This research involves a quasi-experimental study of 40 community college students working on group projects. The students were sorted into treatment and control groups, and asked to work in an online forum designed for team collaboration. In the control group, the virtual facilitator was programmed to remain inactive. For teams in the treatment group, the virtual facilitator intervened with prompts when it was triggered by certain keywords and phrases. Using the grounded theory approach, researchers reviewed and analyzed transcripts to find themes and patterns, which were then coded.

"Applying Fellegi-Sunter (FS) Model for Traceability Link Recovery between Bug Databases and Version Archives","A. Sureka; S. Lal; L.

Previous studies show that bug databases and version databases are often used as standalone and separate repositories without explicit linkages between issue reports and corresponding commit transactions. This is because developers often do not explicitly mention or tag commit transactions with the relevant bug report IDs. The lack of explicit links between these two databases has been identified as a serious process data quality issue (incomplete and biased data) having implications in predictive model building (such as defect density and error proneness computation) and hypothesis-testing based on the dataset. Researchers have proposed solutions to link the two databases and performed experiments on open source projects such as Fire Fox Mozilla. We review previous approaches and propose a novel technique (based on Fellegi-Sunter (FS) Model for record linkages) to automatically integrate the two databases that overcomes some of the drawbacks of traditional methods. We validate the proposed approach by performing experiments on publicly available bug and version dataset obtained from two open-source projects (Apache HTTP Server and WikiMedia). The results of our experiments demonstrate that the proposed solution is effective in recovering trace ability links (missing links) between bug-fixing commits and corresponding bug reports.","1530-1362;15301362","Electronic:978-0-7695-4609-4; POD:978-1-4577-2199-1","10.1109/APSEC.2011.12","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6130681","Automated Software Engineering;Data Integration;Defect Tracking Systems;Fellegi-Sunter (FS) Model;Mining Software Repositories;Record Linkages;Software Engineering Process Data Analysis;Traceability Link Recovery;Version Archives","Couplings;Databases;Joining processes;Software;Software engineering;Training;Vectors","database management systems;program debugging;system recovery","FS;Fellegi-Sunter application;Fire Fox Mozilla;HTTP Server;WikiMedia;bug databases;error proneness computation;open-source projects;software development;source code version control systems;traceability link recovery;tracking systems;version archives;version databases","","4","","14","","","","5-8 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To achieve this goal, we reviewed the existing models, theories, and frameworks that could explain the cognitive processes of human-visualization interaction in investigative analysis. Then, we conducted a qualitative experiment with six novice participants, using a slightly modified version of pair analytics, and analyzed the results through the open-coding method. As a result, we came up with four visual analytic roadblocks and explained these roadblocks using existing cognitive models and theories.

In addition, the scheduling policies and parameters on both the ECUs and the communication buses over which they communicate also need to be specified. These policies and parameters are computed from high-level timing and control performance constraints. The proposed tutorial will cover different aspects of this design flow, with a focus on timing and schedulability problems. After reviewing the basic concepts of worst-case execution time analysis and schedulability analysis, we will discuss the differences between meeting timing constraints (as in classical real-time systems) and meeting control performance constraints (e.g., stability, steady and transient state performance). We will then describe various control performance related schedulability analysis techniques and how they may be tied to model-based software development. Finally, we will discuss various schedule synthesis techniques, both for ECUs as well as for communication protocols like FlexRay, so that control performance constraints specified at the model-level may be satisfied.

If the program code is refactored, however, the specifications need also to be changed. This can be facilitated by specification refactoring rules which allows such changes to be made systematically along with the changes to the code. A set of minimal and complete set of refactoring rules have been devised for the Object-Z specification language.

Despite this, identification of faulty code can consume 30-40% time of error correction. Previous fault-discovery techniques focusing on field failures either require many pass-fail traces, discover only crashing failures, or identify faulty ""files"" (which are of large granularity) as origin of the source code. In our earlier work (the F007 approach), we identify faulty ""functions"" (which are of small granularity) in a field trace by using earlier resolved traces of the same release, which limits it to the known faulty functions. This paper overcomes this limitation by proposing a new ""strategy"" to identify new and old faulty functions using F007. This strategy uses failed traces of mutants (artificial faults) and failed traces of prior releases to identify faulty functions in the traces of succeeding release. Our results on two UNIX utilities (i.e., Flex and Gzip) show that faulty functions in the traces of the majority (60-85%) of failures of a new software release can be identified by reviewing only 20% of the code. If compared against prior techniques then this is a notable improvement in terms of contextual knowledge required and accuracy in the discovery of finer-grain fault origin.","0270-5257;02705257","Electronic:978-1-4503-0445-0; POD:978-1-4503-0445-0","10.1145/1985793.1985959","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6032562","decision tree;execution traces;faulty function;mutants","Decision trees;Fault diagnosis;Flexible printed circuits;Measurement;Software;Testing;USA Councils","Unix;program diagnostics","NIER track;UNIX utilities;crashing failures;fault diagnosis;faulty code;program code;source code","","2","","17","","","","21-28 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Objective: We investigate how the context of models, the independent variables used, and the modeling techniques applied influence the performance of fault prediction models. Method: We used a systematic literature review to identify 208 fault prediction studies published from January 2000 to December 2010. We synthesize the quantitative and qualitative results of 36 studies which report sufficient contextual and methodological information according to the criteria we develop and apply. Results: The models that perform well tend to be based on simple modeling techniques such as Naive Bayes or Logistic Regression. Combinations of independent variables have been used by models that perform well. Feature selection has been applied to these combinations when models are performing particularly well. Conclusion: The methodology used to build models seems to be influential to predictive performance. Although there are a set of fault prediction studies in which confidence is possible, more studies are needed that use a reliable methodology and which report their context, methodology, and performance comprehensively.","0098-5589;00985589","","10.1109/TSE.2011.103","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6035727","Systematic literature review;software fault prediction","Analytical models;Context modeling;Data models;Fault diagnosis;Predictive models;Software testing;Systematics","Bayes methods;regression analysis;software fault tolerance;software quality","contextual information;cost reduction;fault prediction models;fault prediction performance;fault prediction study;feature selection;independent variables;logistic regression;methodological information;naive Bayes;predictive performance;reliable methodology;simple modeling techniques;software engineering;software quality;systematic literature review","","171","","","","","20111006","Nov.-Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

It uses resources, such as an expert, source and target document, and traceability approach, to create/recover traceability links. However, it does not provide any guidance that how much we can trust on available resources. We propose Trustrace, a trust-based traceability recovery process, to improve expert trust on a recovered link and trust over the traceability inputs. Trustrace has three sub components, in particular, Link trust improver (LTI), traceability factor controller (TFC), and a hybrid traceability approach (HTA). LTI uses various source of information, such as temporal information, design documents, source code structure, and so on, to increase experts' trust over a link. To develop TFC, we will perform a systematic literature review and empirical studies to find out which factors impact the traceability-process inputs and document these factors in a trust pattern. TFC trust pattern will help practitioner and researchers to know which steps they can take to avoid/control these factors to improve their trust on these inputs. In the HTA, we will combine different traceability recovery approaches. All approaches have different positive and negative points, we will combine all the positive points of different approaches to increase experts' trust over the HTA.

Recently, there has been a growing interest in data mining API usage patterns to discover potential bugs such as resource leaks. However, the usage patterns mined are specific to a certain library, which cannot be applied to detect bugs in other libraries. In this paper, we present an idea called MODE, “Mine Once, Detect Everywhere”, to address the universality of such patterns, and use them to detect potential resource leaks automatically before code check-in. We propose an efficient algorithm to record the most valuable API calls that are related to resource usage during program execution, and mine resource usage patterns from the traces with a sequence miner.

The COSMIC FSM (Functional Size Measurement) method treats the intended software to be measured as a black box, and measures CFP (COSMIC Function Points) based only on data movement in and out of the software. Therefore, CFP can be measured on requirements defined early, and be used to estimate Code Size if there exists a strong correlation between CFP and Code Size. We have conducted four experiments in the automotive industry showing strong correlation between CFP and implemented Code Size in Bytes. All four experiments, of which two have not been published before, show equally strong correlation but the linear relationship is different between the experiments.</p> <p><b>Goal:</b> This paper aims to identify the factors affecting the linear relationship. With these factors, we can categorize new requirements to be measured and select the proper linear relationship to convert CFP into Bytes, i.e. estimate Code Size.</p> <p><b>Method:</b> We replicate our earlier experiments with software components of new types, and review the results from all our experiments. Potential factors affecting implemented Code Size are identified by performing open-ended interviews with domain experts.</p> <p><b>Results:</b> We have in the automotive industry identified a set of factors that can be used to categorize the software components we want to measure; functionality type, quality constraints, and development methods and tools.</p> <p><b>Conclusions:</b> COSMIC can produce accurate Code Size Estimates provided that sub-sets of cohesive and uniform requirements can be identified. Moreover, similar requirements must have been measured before to establish the linear relationship between CFP and Bytes. Finally, the sub-sets of requirements need to be able to categorize based on factors that affect the linear relation- - ship. With this approach, even complex calculations can be measured, provided that they are proportional to the number of data movements.</p>","","","10.1145/1852786.1852821","","","COSMIC function points;UML components;categorization;functional size measurement;software code size;system architecture","","","","","4","2","","","","","16-17 Sept. 2010","","ACM","ACM Conferences"

Additionally, metric-based detection algorithms claim to identify the ""smelly"" components automatically. This paper presents results for an empirical study performed in a commercial environment. The study investigates the way professional software developers detect god class code smells, then compares these results to automatic classification. The results show that, even though the subjects perceive detecting god classes as an easy task, the agreement for the classification is low. Misplaced methods are a strong driver for letting subjects identify god classes as such. Earlier proposed metric-based detection approaches performed well compared to the human classification. These results lead to the conclusion that an automated metric-based pre-selection decreases the effort spent on manual code inspections. Automatic detection accompanied by a manual review increases the overall confidence in the results of metric-based classifiers.</p>","","","10.1145/1852786.1852797","","","code inspection;code smells;empirical study;god class;maintainability","","","","","12","","","","","","16-17 Sept. 2010","","ACM","ACM Conferences"

Specifically:</p> <p>•what they liked and disliked about using functional languages</p> <p>•what was easy and hard about learning and using functional languages</p> <p>•what worked/didn't work for helping them learn to program in functional languages</p> <p>•which functional features they used and didn't use</p> <p>•general observations about the code that they wrote</p> <p>•what (if anything) they took away from the experience</p> <p>A design principle of the implementation effort was to by default avoid the use of imperative features. Previous experience and review of the literature suggested that many parts of a compiler could be written as well or better using primarily functional code, but that restricting ourselves entirely to the functional fragment of SML was probably not reasonable. We describe our experiences with this, and the tradeoffs that we encountered. Specifically:</p> <p>•During the project we experimented with both immutable and mutable intermediate representations (IRs). We describe and motivate some of the scenarios where we used - - one or the other, explain our experiences with this, and describe cases where we feel that we made an inappropriate initial choice.</p> <p>•We chose to avoid all global mutable state in the compiler. Most notably, symbol tables and global configuration information are always passed explicitly as parameters to parts of the compiler that require them. This choice had benefits and costs, and we discuss our experience with this.</p> <p>We also describe some of the features of SML that we found useful, and discuss some of the lack of features and quirks of SML that annoyed us. Specifically:</p> <p>•We discuss places where we encountered limitations in the module system. These include the lack of uniformity between the signature and structure language, and the lack of recursive modules.</p> <p>•We describe some of the ways in which we believe that better syntactic support could have lessened the programming burden, especially with respect to attempting to be purely functional. Examples of this include a type class mechanism and/or monadic syntax to lessen the burden of passing around explicit state, better syntactic support for using the imperative features of the language, and better support for custom control operators.</p>","","","10.1145/1900160.1900175","","","","","","","","0","","","","","","1-2 Oct. 2010","","ACM","ACM Conferences"
"Feature oriented-programming: back to the future","C. Prehofer","Fraunhofer ESK, Munich, Germany","Proceedings of the 2nd International Workshop on Feature-Oriented Software Development","20110708","2010","","","1","1","<p>Feature-oriented programming has its origin in the old quest of computer science: modular composition of software ""artifacts"" in software development. While there exist many notions of modularity and composition, feature-oriented programming tackles the case of highly-entangled software features where typical module or component concepts fail. The reasons for this are feature interactions and dependencies which make it very hard to write modular software which can be composed in a flexible way. In contrast to other efforts like aspect-oriented programming, feature-oriented programming has from the beginning focused on the semantics or behavior of software, not just on code modularity.</p> <p>In this presentation, we review the origins of feature composition and feature interactions, which first occurred as an explicit research problem in telecommunication software. We argue that feature interactions are pervasive in many areas of software development and are a common source of modularity and quality problems. Then, we present more precise formalization of modularity and compositionality of features. We discuss when adding features is modular or ""harmless"" from a semantic or behavioral point of view. In particular, we focus on modularity and interaction for multiple feature compositions. A future challenge for feature-oriented software is the graphical modeling of features and feature interactions. As we aim to have modular composition for graphical models and to generate code from these graphical artifacts, it is important to have precise semantics and clear refinement concepts. For this, we discuss how features and interactions can be represented by state-based specifications in a graphical way. Refinement concepts are presented which allow the flexible composition of features and interactions in statechart diagrams.</p>","","","10.1145/1868688.1868689","","","composition;feature interactions;feature-oriented programming;keynote;modularity","","","","","0","","","","","","10-10 Oct. 2010","","ACM","ACM Conferences"

Systems such as XVCL, DMS, ASF+SDF, Stratego and TXL have proven mature, efficient and effective in a wide range of applications. Even so, adoption remains a serious issue - almost all successful production applications of these systems in practice either involve help from the original authors or years of experience to get rolling. While work on accessibility is active, with efforts such as ETXL, Stratego XT, Rascal and Colm, the fundamental big step remains - it's not obvious how to apply a general purpose transformational system to any given generation or transformation problem, and the real power is in the paradigms of use, not the languages themselves.</p> <p>In this talk I will propose an agenda for addressing this problem by taking our own advice - designing and implementing domain specific languages (DSLs) for specific generative, transformational and analysis problem domains. We widely advise end users of the need for DSLs for their kinds of problems - why not for our kinds? And we use our tools for implementing their DSLs - why not our own? I will outline a general method for using transformational techniques to implement transformational and generative DSLs, and review applications of the method to implementing example text-based DSLs for model-based code generation and static code analysis. Finally, I will outline some first steps in implementing model transformation DSLs using the same idea - retaining the maturity and efficiency of our existing tools while bringing them to the masses by ""eating our own dogfood"".</p>","0362-1340;03621340","","10.1145/1837852.1621609","","","domain-specific languages;generative programming;model driven engineering;source transformation systems","","","","","0","","","","","","February 2010","","ACM","ACM Journals & Magazines"

In our model, the web framework enforces privilege separation and isolation of web applications by requiring the use of an object-capability language and providing interfaces that expose limited, explicitly-specified privileges to application components. This approach restricts what each component of the application can do and quarantines buggy or compromised code. It also provides a way to more safely integrate third-party, less-trusted code into a web application. We have implemented a prototype of this model based upon the Java Servlet framework and used it to build a webmail application.

Consequences of refactoring are only moderately discussed in literature. In this work, we emphasize the importance of documenting such consequences, by reviewing relevant literature and giving our views on the topic. We do this in three steps: first, we investigate how high level quality attributes (including testability and other maintainability aspects based on the ISO 9126 standard and fault proneness) can be estimated based on measurable metrics in the code, like complexity, size, and coupling. In the second step, we examine what effect of individual refactoring techniques can have on such metrics. Finally, we combine these findings to get a view on how refactoring can influence high level quality characteristics. With this work, we want to foster discussion in this important topic, rather than giving a solution to the problem, as it requires a vast amount of further research by the testing and software quality communities.</p>","","","10.1145/1890692.1890700","","","ISO 9126 quality model;code metrics;error proneness;refactoring;static software measurement;testability","","","","","0","","","","","","21-21 June 2010","","ACM","ACM Conferences"

The Device-Based Software Architecture (DBSA) is a highly portable and generic data mining software framework where processing tasks are modeled as components linked together to form a data mining application. The name of the architecture comes from the analogy that each processing task in the framework can be thought of as a device. The framework handles all the devices in the same manner, regardless of whether they have a counterpart in the real world or whether they are just logical devices inside the framework. The DBSA offers many reusable devices, ready to be included in applications, and the application programmer can easily code new devices for the architecture. The framework is bundled with connections to several widely used external tools and languages, making prototyping new applications easy and fast. In the paper we compare DBSA to existing data mining frameworks, review its design and present a case study application implemented with the framework. The paper shows that the DBSA can act as a base for diverse data mining applications.</p>","","","10.1145/1774088.1774562","","","data mining;software frameworks","","","","","1","","","","","","22-26 March 2010","","ACM","ACM Conferences"

For example, visualization tools support the development of a conceptual-level understanding of how programs work, and automatic assessment tools give feedback on submitted tasks. We implemented a combined tool that closely integrates programming tasks with visualizations of program execution and thus lets students practice writing code and more easily transition to visually tracing it in order to locate programming errors. In this paper we present Jype, a web-based tool that provides an environment for visualizing the line-by-line execution of Python programs and for solving programming exercises with support for immediate automatic feedback and an integrated visual debugger. Moreover, the debugger allows stepping back in the visualization of the execution as if executing in reverse.

However, concurrent programming, which is always challenging, is made much more so by two problems. First, real multiprocessors typically do not provide the sequentially consistent memory that is assumed by most work on semantics and verification. Instead, they have relaxed memory models, varying in subtle ways between processor families, in which different hardware threads may have only loosely consistent views of a shared memory. Second, the public vendor architectures, supposedly specifying what programmers can rely on, are often in ambiguous informal prose (a particularly poor medium for loose specifications), leading to widespread confusion.</p> <p>In this paper we focus on x86 processors. We review several recent Intel and AMD specifications, showing that all contain serious ambiguities, some are arguably too weak to program above, and some are simply unsound with respect to actual hardware. We present a new <i>x86-TSO</i> programmer's model that, to the best of our knowledge, suffers from none of these problems. It is mathematically precise (rigorously defined in HOL4) but can be presented as an intuitive abstract machine which should be widely accessible to working programmers. We illustrate how this can be used to reason about the correctness of a Linux spinlock implementation and describe a general theory of data-race freedom for x86-TSO. This should put x86 multiprocessor system building on a more solid foundation; it should also provide a basis for future work on verification of such systems.</p>","0001-0782;00010782","","10.1145/1785414.1785443","","","","","","","","28","","","","","","July 2010","","ACM","ACM Journals & Magazines"

Tekalp","Ko&#231; University, Stambul, Turkey","Proceedings of the 13th ACM international conference on Modeling, analysis, and simulation of wireless and mobile systems","20110708","2010","","","3","4","<p>With wider availability of low cost multi-view cameras, 3D displays, and broadband communication options, 3D media is destined to move from the movie theater to home and mobile platforms. In the near term, popular 3D media will most likely be in the form of stereoscopic video with associated spatial audio. Recent trials indicate that consumers are willing to watch stereoscopic 3D media on their TVs, laptops, and mobile phones. While it is possible to broadcast 3D stereoscopic media (two-views) over digital TV platforms today, streaming over IP will provide a more flexible approach for distribution of 3D media to users with different connection bandwidths and different 3D displays. In the intermediate term, free-view 3D video and 3DTV with multi-view capture are next steps in the evolution of 3D media technology. Recent free-view 3D auto-stereoscopic displays can display multi-view video, ranging from 5 to 200 views. Transmission of multi-view 3D media, via broadcast or on-demand, to end users with varying 3D display terminals and bandwidths is one of the biggest challenges to realize the vision of bringing 3D media experience to the home and mobile devices. This requires flexible rate-scalable, resolution-scalable, view-scalable, view-selective, and packet-loss resilient transport methods. In this talk, first I will briefly review the state of the art in 3D video formats, coding methods, IP streaming protocols and streaming architectures. We will then take a look at 3D video transport options. There are two main platforms for 3D broadcasting: standard digital television (DTV) platforms and the IP platform. I will summarize the approach of European project DIOMEDES which is developing novel methods for adaptive streaming of multi-view video over a combination of DVB and IP platforms. I will also summarize additional challenges associated with real-time interactive 3D video communications for applications such as 3D telepresence. Finally, open research challenges f- - or the long term vision of haptic video and holographic 3D video will be presented.</p>","","","10.1145/1868521.1868523","","","3dtv;media streaming;video communication","","","","","0","","","","","","17-21 Oct. 2010","","ACM","ACM Conferences"

Several experimental studies show that on average 15 percent of a software system can contain source code clones - repeatedly reused fragments of similar code. While code duplication may increase the speed of initial software development, it undoubtedly leads to problems during software maintenance and support. That is why many developers agree that software clones should be detected and dealt with at every stage of software development life cycle. This paper is a brief survey of current state-of-the-art in clone detection. First, we highlight main sources of code cloning such as copy-and-paste programming, mental code patterns and performance optimizations. We discuss reasons behind the use of these techniques from the developer's point of view and possible alternatives to them. Second, we outline major negative effects that clones have on software development. The most serious drawback duplicated code have on software maintenance is increasing the cost of modifications - any modification that changes cloned code must be propagated to every clone instance in the program. Software clones may also create new software bugs when a programmer makes some mistakes during code copying and modification. Increase of source code size due to duplication leads to additional difficulty of code comprehension. Third, we review existing clone detection techniques. Classification based on used source code representation model is given in this work. We also describe and analyze some concrete examples of clone detection techniques highlighting main distinctive features and problems that are present in practical clone detection. Finally, we point out some open problems in the area of clone detection. Currently questions like ""What is a code clone?"", ""Can we predict the impact clones have on software quality"" and ""How can we increase both clone detection precision and recall at the same time? "" stay open to further re- - search. We list the most important questions in modern clone detection and explain why they continue to remain unanswered despite all the progress in clone detection research.","","Electronic:978-1-4577-0606-6; POD:978-1-4577-0605-9","10.1109/CEE-SECR.2010.5783148","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5783148","Clone detection;overview;program analysis;quality assurance;software maintenance","Cloning;Data mining;Electronic mail;Linux;Programming;Software maintenance","program debugging;software maintenance","clone detection techniques;code comprehension;code duplication;copy-and-paste programming;mental code patterns;performance optimizations;software bugs;software development life cycle;software maintenance;software support;source code size","","4","","21","","","","13-15 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, recent results suggest that this practice is not followed to the extent preferred by industry. In order to pinpoint specific obstacles limiting its industrial adoption we have conducted a systematic literature review on empirical studies explicitly focusing on TDD as well as indirectly addressing TDD. Our review has identified seven limiting factors viz., increased development time, insufficient TDD experience/knowledge, lack of upfront design, domain and tool specific issues, lack of developer skill in writing test cases, insufficient adherence to TDD protocol, and legacy code. The results of this study is of special importance to the testing community, since it outlines the direction for further detailed scientific investigations as well as highlights the requirement of guidelines to overcome these limiting factors for successful industrial adoption of TDD.","2159-4848;21594848","Electronic:978-0-7695-4342-0; POD:978-1-61284-174-8","10.1109/ICST.2011.19","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5770623","Test driven developmen;agile software development;empirical studies;systematic review;unit testing","Data mining;Databases;Limiting;Programming;Protocols;Systematics;Testing","program testing;software maintenance;software prototyping","agile software development;industrial adoption;legacy code;test driven development","","13","","58","","","","21-25 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Review of many technologies in the involvement, the essential idea is to remove power redundancy. The GAF algorithm is able to get a WSN with longer lifetime by reducing the node redundancy in transmitting data, On the other hand, the CODE, based on the GAF algorithm, is able to deliver data according to the data direction that is, as a result, reduce the probability of blandness of data delivery and reduce the power consumption. Algorithms if rooted on the GAF algorithm will have an important characteristic that the denser the nodes are distributed, the longer the lifetime is, However, when node distribution is getting denser, the distance between nodes will be closer, and the power if transmitted still in the same power level for data delivery will no doubt bring about power redundancy and even commit data confliction. In this paper, we come forward an algorithm on the basis of the CODE algorithm, namely the adapting CODE (ACODE) which is able to adaptively change the data transmitting power on each node, reducing power consumption, and accordingly prolong the lifecycle for a specific WSN. According to ACODE algorithm, when a route is establishing, a specific package for measuring power is sent out to measure the optimal transmitting power, and this optimal power will be used throughout the whole procedure of data transmission. The NS simulation in this paper verifies that, comparing with the CODE algorithm, the ACODE can improve lifecycle for a WSN as much as 20 percentages.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4212-6; POD:978-1-4244-8333-4","10.1109/ISDEA.2010.244","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5743147","Adaptive Power;CODE;NS2;Wireless Sensor Networks","Delay;Jitter;Power demand;Power measurement;Protocols;Throughput;Wireless sensor networks","data communication;power consumption;redundancy;wireless sensor networks","adapting CODE algorithm;data delivery;data transmission;data transmitting power;node distribution;node redundancy;power consumption;power redundancy;wireless sensor networks","","0","","8","","","","13-14 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Existing work does not provide any guidance to developers to review and correct concern mappings. In this context, this paper presents the characterization and classification of eight concern mapping mistakes commonly made by developers. These mistakes were found to be associated with various properties of concerns and modules in the source code. The mistake categories were derived from actual mappings of 10 concerns in 12 versions of industry systems. In order to further evaluate to what extent these mistakes also occur in wider contexts, we ran two experiments where 26 subjects mapped 10 concerns in two systems.

In a recent paper, we have shown that this fact can be exploited by a trivial classifier ordering files just by their size: such a classifier performs surprisingly good, at least when effort is ignored during the evaluation. When effort is considered, many classifiers perform not significantly better than a random selection of modules.

The code becomes more and more complex and drifts away from its original design. One of the first steps in maintaining an object-oriented system is to assess its design, repeatedly throughout the system development lifecycle. Early identification of those parts of the system that need to be reviewed, ensures a more stable design of the successive versions, hindering errors propagation. The main objective of this research is to define a conceptual framework concerning object-oriented design (OOD) assessment. The proposed evaluation methodology is based on metrics and uses fuzzy analysis for the interpretation of the obtained measurement results. This work could pave the way for providing a complex evaluation methodology through the four layers of abstraction: a meta-model for OOD assessment, defined in a standard terminology and formalism using algebraic knowledge, a library of OOD metrics definitions, setting the assessment objectives and a method for the assessment results interpretation.

The NIS is expected to provide some benefits such as development planning based on sufficient accurate population data, delivery of social services such as health, retirement benefits and social administration; delivery of credit facilities; and identification of individuals for voting, insurance, licensing and general national security purposes. The NIS lacks a geospatial database and this could be a setback to the realization of the benefits of the NIS to the citizenry in Ghana. Literature reviewed shows that high quality geographic database is essential to having an effective citizenry identification system, to take care of the spatio-temporal dynamics which is key to the sustainability of such a system. Also this will aid policy makers, social scientist and government to geovisualise available citizenry data for research and decision making. This paper attempts to propose answers to the following questions: Can the NIS keep track of the spatial information pertaining to an individual or a group of people due to relocation? How can spatial information be validated during NIS registration? The paper first investigates novel geo-coding system that would be appropriate for providing spatial information of persons in Ghana. Secondly, the paper looks at the architectural framework for integrating a distributed geo-database into the NIS of Ghana. The paper then proposes a prototype system in the form of a Geo-demographic Information System for delivery of geographical data, demographic data, mapping capabilities and geo-information services.

To do this, we use qualitative methods applied to a quantitative study of code evaluation technique effectiveness.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4241-6; POD:978-1-4244-8539-0","10.1109/QUATIC.2010.50","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5655565","Empirical research;Human factors;Opinions and preferences;Quantitative and qualitative research;Software engineering research;Validation;Verification","Complexity theory;Fault diagnosis;Human factors;Humans;Radio access networks;Software;Testing","formal verification;program testing;software quality","code evaluation technique;defect detection;software development process;software products quality;testing;validation;verification","","0","","11","","","","Sept. 29 2010-Oct. 2 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The paper explains how the results of static analysis can be used to orchestrate dynamic analysis. The proposed method was successfully applied on the NASA's Goddard Mission Services Evolution Center (GMSEC) software product line. The results show that the GMSEC has a) a novel reusable vendor-independent middleware abstraction layer that allows the NASA's missions to configure the middleware of interest without changing the publishers' or subscribers' source code, and b) a high-priority bug due to behavioral discrepancies, which were eluded during testing and code reviews, among different implementations of the same APIs for different vendors.","1095-1350;10951350","Electronic:978-0-7695-4123-5; POD:978-1-4244-8911-4","10.1109/WCRE.2010.27","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5645557","Architectural Styles;Colored Petri Nets;Component-Connector Views;Middleware;Static and Dynamic Analysis;Vendors","Computer architecture;Computer languages;Middleware;Monitoring;Probes;Software;Software architecture","message passing;middleware;program debugging;program diagnostics","API;NASA goddard mission services evolution center;architectural analysis;behavioral discrepancy;dynamic analysis;implemented system;interaction behavior;publisher subscriber architectural style;reusable questions;reusable vendor independent middleware abstraction layer;software product line;static analysis","","3","","23","","","","13-16 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we revisit two common findings in the bug prediction literature: 1) Process metrics (e.g., change history) outperform product metrics (e.g., LOC), 2) Package-level predictions outperform file-level predictions. Through a case study on three projects from the Eclipse Foundation, we find that the first finding holds when effort is considered, while the second finding does not hold.

Applying a grounded theory approach we identified 14 factors which impact the architectural process. We found that scope creep is more likely to occur, late changes can imply more extensive rework and that business engineers need to be more aware of the technical impact of their decisions. In addition, the introduced Domain-Specific Language (DSL) provides a new common idiom that can be used by more team members and will ease communication among team members and with clients. Also, modelers need to be much more explicit and complete in their descriptions. Parallel development of a code generator and defining a proper meta-model require additional time investments. Lastly, the more central role of software architecture design documentation requires more structured, detailed and complete architectural information and consequently, more frequent reviews.","1089-6503;10896503","Electronic:978-0-7695-4170-9; POD:978-1-4244-7901-6","10.1109/SEAA.2010.63","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5598116","Industrial Case Study;Model Driven Development (MDD);Software Architecture","Business;DSL;Interviews;Lead;Programming;Software;Unified modeling language","software architecture;specification languages","code generator;domain-specific language;large-scale industrial software development project;model driven development;software architecture process","","5","","13","","","","1-3 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While link adaptation in single antenna systems is now mature, its application to multiple-input multiple-output communication links, presented in several emerging wireless standards, has been challenging. The main reason is that the space-time transmission strategy can also be adjusted in MIMO communication links, introducing a new dimension for adaptation. This means that practical MIMO link adaptation algorithms must also provide a dynamic adaptation between diversity and multiplexing modes of operation. This article reviews a recently proposed framework for adaptive MIMO architectures and shows how to use this framework to reduce adaptive control overhead.

Due to their automation they are less time-consuming and error-prone then manual reviews. However, they produce large quantities of warnings that developers have to manually examine and understand.In this paper, we look at a solution that makes static code analysis tools more useful as an early vulnerability detector. We use flow-sensitive, interprocedural and context-sensitive data flow analysis to determine the point of user input and its migration through the source code to the actual exploit. By determining a vulnerabilities point of entry we lower the number of warnings a tool produces and we provide the developer with more information why this warning could be a real security threat. We use our approach in three different ways depending on what tool we examined. First, With the commercial static code analysis tool, Coverity, we reanalyze its results and create a set of warnings that are specifically relevant from a security perspective. Secondly, we altered the open source analysis tool Findbugs to only analyze code that has been tainted by user input.

I'm excited with my new role as incoming Editor-in-Chief (EIC) of TPDS and look forward to serving the community over the next few years. My goal as EIC is to continue to work on increasing the visibility and relevance and impact of TPDS, as well as the quality and timeliness of the review process, to ensure that TPDS is the premier Transactions in the field. The IEEE is a hallmark of quality for technical publication. The value TPDS brings to the international community is in its collection of the highest quality research that is relevant to academia, industry, and laboratories. I will investigate new opportunities for TPDS to capture the best research while maintaining its emphasis on highest quality papers. TPDS also needs to respond to a dynamic and rapidly evolving research and publication landscape. As EIC, I will work with the IEEE community to ensure that TPDS does respond appropriately, and will carefully work with the editorial board to revisit the scope and recruit new editorial board members as needed. An important and rapid growing conversation is related to the repeatability of published research and the submission of supplementary material such as code and data. I am part of this conversation, and will work with the EB and the community to explore how to bring these practices in meaningful and measured ways to TPDS.","1045-9219;10459219","","10.1109/TPDS.2017.2768538","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8173510","","","","","","","","","","","","Jan. 1 2018","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
"Detection and location of passive and semi-passive RFID tags in in-door environments","I. White","University of Cambridge, U.K.","2015 International Conference on Pervasive and Embedded Computing and Communication Systems (PECCS)","20160602","2015","","","IS-11","IS-12","This presentation will review the development of Radio frequency identification (RFID) technology, which has received increasing research interest in recent years due to its huge potential in asset tracking and localization. The most promising feature of this technique is its ability to identify an RFID tagged object from a distance, which, unlike traditional bar-code techniques, does not require line of sight between the reader and tag. Clear applications have been identified for active, semi-passive and passive RFID tags, with battery-free tags being recognised to be particularly appropriate for very low cost situations. A challenge with such tags however is in ensuring highly reliable detection particularly in environments where in-door features lead to RF nulls. This, in turn affects location accuracy. In recent years, the problem of nulls has been overcome by using phased array antennas and distributed antenna system (DAS) approaches. For example, researchers have achieved wide area coverage by maximizing the link budget through space time array techniques, smart antennas and digital beam forming. In respect of DAS, excellent performance has been achieved by distributed transmitter and receiver signal control and signal processing, so that >99% reliability has been achieved for tag numbers in excess of 100 over areas of up to 20 m × 20 m. Research has additionally identified that by careful design, larger areas can be monitored using multiple cells where cell to cell interference can be used to enhance read reliability. Wireless antenna nodes can also be used to enhance read range. This paper will therefore review the current status of this rapidly developing field, and describe recent advances in location.","","Electronic:978-989-758-137-3; POD:978-1-4673-8406-3","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7483721","","","","","","","","","","","","11-13 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this issue, we are publishing four papers, each with different types of active content. Our TPEL active content guidelines will continue to evolve as more papers submit data, movies, source codes, or other active content material. However, as with these four papers, any future papers must upload supplemental digital content at the time of initial manuscript submission, allowing the content to be fully reviewed by both the paper reviewers and editors. For example, each of the four papers was accepted based on its technical research contributions, independent from the active content. This is a requirement for the acceptance of any TPEL manuscript. A footnote explaining the active content will appear on the paper, and there is a special icon on the IEEE Xplore platform for the paper that allows readers to download the multimedia.

"Conceptual modeling in Agile information systems development","A. Olivé","Universitat Polit&#x00E8;cnica de Catalunya, Spain","2014 9th International Conference on Evaluation of Novel Approaches to Software Engineering (ENASE)","20150402","2014","","","1","1","The nature and the role of conceptual modeling in information systems development has neither in theory nor in practice been established satisfactorily. There are diverse views on what conceptual modeling is and on how to perform it. In one extreme, there is the view that conceptual modeling is an (optional) activity whose main purpose is to improve communication between the parties involved in the development process. In the other extreme, there is the view (shared by us) that conceptual modeling is an activity that is necessarily performed in all cases, and whose purpose is to define the conceptual schema, that is, the general knowledge a system needs to know to perform its functions. The latter has been captured in what we call the principle of necessity of conceptual Schemas, which states that ""To develop an information system it is necessary to define its conceptual schema"". Agile development processes have added even more confusion to conceptual modeling. The value of ""Working software over comprehensive documentation"", stated in the manifesto for agile software development, seems to undermine conceptual Schemas in favor of working code. However, as we explain in the talk, it does not need to be so. In the talk, we present a framework that describes the contents of conceptual Schemas, the form they may take and the roles they play in information systems development. Based on that framework, we review the principle of necessity of conceptual Schemas. We then apply the framework to the particular case of agile development, and discuss the validity of the principle of necessity in that case. The framework is intended to be useful for inspiring future research, and for improving the practice and teaching of conceptual modeling.","","Electronic:978-989-758-030-7; POD:978-1-4799-7919-6","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7077102","","","","","","0","","","","","","28-30 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We are indeed delighted that the conference aims to providing a premier forum for presentation of research results and experience reporting on the cutting edge research in the general areas of computing, telecommunications, management and their applications. This year, we have received many high quality submissions from more than 22 countries. Each paper received at least three peer technical reviews, comprised of more than 160 TPC members from academia, government laboratories, and industries. After carefully examining all the received review reports, the IEEE ComManTel 2014 TPC finally selected only very high quality papers for presentation at the conference and publication in the IEEE ComManTel 2014 proceedings. The first day will start with a free Tutorial presentation chosen from renowned world-class leaders in the area. On Sunday, Prof. Hossam Hassanein, from Queen's University, Canada will talk about the “The Evolution of Information Networks around Data.” On Monday, we start the with a Keynote Speech delivered by IEEE Fellow and Distinguished Professor Hsiao-Hwa Chen of the National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan. He will talk to us about the “Design of MIMO systems based on chip-level space-time coded CDMA system.” Right after the Keynote, Prof. Markus Fiedler from the Blekinge Institute of Technology, Sweden, will also deliver a free Tutorial on “Quantitative Relationships Between QoE and Energy Consumption.” This year, the technical sessions reflect the growing interest in a wide range of spectrum, including wireless communications and networks, computing aspects, management and applications of these technologies in ou- daily lives. Outstanding papers will be selected and invited for Special Issues in well-known international journals and top quality papers will receive the Best Paper Award. Our objective in the future is to increase the quality and therefore reduce the acceptance rate further. In addition, we would like to increase the number of Tracks to cover other areas and introduce Workshops that of interest to meet the conference theme.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-2904-7; Electronic:978-1-4799-2903-0; POD:978-1-4799-5385-1","10.1109/ComManTel.2014.6825560","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6825560","","","","","","0","","","","","","27-29 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Foreword","","","2012 Third International Workshop on Managing Technical Debt (MTD)","20120628","2012","","","iii","iv","The Third International Workshop on Managing Technical Debt, MTD 2012, was this year co-located with the 34rd International Conference on Software Engineering at Zurich, Switzerland. This is the second year that we are holding this workshop co-located with ICSE. The technical debt metaphor has gained significant traction in the software development community as a way to understand and communicate issues of intrinsic quality, value, and cost in the past few years. The idea is that developers sometimes accept compromises in a system in one dimension (e.g., modularity) to meet an urgent demand in some other dimension (e.g., a deadline), and that such compromises incur a ""debt:"" on which ""interest"" has to be paid and which should be repaid at some point for the long-term health of the project. Little is known about technical debt, beyond feelings and opinions. The software engineering research community has an opportunity to study this phenomenon and improve the way it is handled. We can offer software engineers a foundation for managing such tradeoffs based on models of their economic impacts. The software engineering community is in the process of building the research agenda around managing technical debt. The purpose of these initial workshops is to bring forward work in progress and ideas from the entire community to collectively vet their validity for the future. In order to support this goal, submissions were open to the members of the program committee as well as the organizing committee. Following a conflict of interest policy, the papers were selected after a peer review by at least three members of the program committee. For this third workshop we accepted 7 full research and 4 short position papers. The accepted submissions cover a range of topics such as: estimating the size and cost of debt, eliciting and visualizing debt, the technical debt landscape ranging from technical debt in software ecosystems to requirements, design and build, and the relationshi- between code defects and debt. Managing technical debt is a broad concern of software engineering that blends research and practice. This can be seen from the program and those involved in the workshop program selection process. To encourage interactive discussion, foster brainstorming and community building the workshop will consist of only short presentations from the accepted papers. These short presentations will provide a basis for the participants to investigate further open research questions and challenges in practice. It is for that purpose the program includes sessions dedicated to open discussion.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-1749-8; POD:978-1-4673-1748-1","10.1109/MTD.2012.6225992","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6225992","","","","","","0","","","","","","5-5 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Optimal and Robust Scheduling for Networked Control Systems [Bookshelf]","K. G. Vamvoudakis","","IEEE Control Systems","20150316","2015","35","2","101","103","The book under review is unique in that it blends tools known from optimal and robust control theory to design performance-oriented, robust, and reliable NCSs with time-deterministic behavior. The problem of computation complexity of offline optimization is solved through fast stochastic algorithms, while the appropriate network configuration is given through measures of robust performance. The authors also provide practical examples driven mainly from the automotive field to show the effectiveness of their approaches. The book is organized in ten chapters, and most chapters represent results published by the authors in scientific journals. For readers with a basic grasp of optimal control, robust control, and communication theory, this books presents a foundation for designing reliable, optimal, and robust controllers across networks. The remarkable points of this book include the development of an engineering tool for NCSs with guaranteed performance and robustness and that the design techniques are applied to hardware-in-the-loop automotive control systems. The material is successfully presented in a form that is pleasant to read. Control practitioners and engineers will be motivated by this blend of theory and practice to enhance the results while also dealing with new challenges that will arise, such as developing plug-and-play model-free controllers that self-heal and solve the optimization problems online, while also attenuating any disturbances entering the network. Two flaws of the book are that the authors expect a certain degree of mathematical sophistication from the reader, but, at the same time, some mathematical derivations seem unclear. The authors should have provided more introductory chapters or appendices. Moreover, they should make available the Matlab code that they used to generate the simulations.","1066-033X;1066033X","","10.1109/MCS.2014.2385294","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7061648","","Book reviews;Control systems;Optimal scheduling;Robust control;Scheduling;Stability analysis","","","","1","","9","","","","April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Misra","","IEEE Wireless Communications","20150309","2015","22","1","5","5","This book explores the use of advanced video communications in wireless networks. Wireless devices are fast becoming the device of choice for the majority of computing users. Smartphones, tablets, and notebooks, are changing the Internet-consumer paradigm. Compared to the recent past where most Internet traffic requests emanated from fixed wired devices (desktops/servers), today a majority of the requests are from fixed/mobile wireless devices. A point of note is that the majority of this traffic would consist of video; global IP video traffic will be 79 percent of all consumer Internet traffic in 2018. In addition, the nature of video traffic will change from single-source video on demand-like traffic to multi-source, interactive video communication; each mobile device can become a video source in the future Internet. This has made advancements in wireless/mobile video applications important. Video communication over wireless has to grapple with several stringent constraints: distributed sourcing, resource constrained devices, heterogeneous communication technologies, limited channel capacity, and high error rates in data delivery. This requires a holistic study of video coding and delivery to meet the quality of service (QoS) requirements. In this book, the editors have presented a compilation of 15 peer-reviewed chapters from several well known researchers in the area of wireless video technologies to provide an overview of the state of the art, challenges, and emerging trends.","1536-1284;15361284","","10.1109/MWC.2015.7054710","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7054710","","Book reviews;Mobile communication;Streaming media;Video coding;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","","","","0","","","","","","February 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This talk is a review on our ongoing research effort to design multi-user Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) systems based on chip-level space-time coded CDMA system. It is characterized by its innovative spreading and space-time codes, namely three dimensional complementary codes (3DCCs), which offer a unique paradigm to design space-time coded signature codes for multi-user MIMO systems. The proposed system achieves interference-resistant performance owing to the unique correlation properties of 3DCCs. It has an ability to offer diversity and multiplexing advantages at the same time with a flexible tradeoff between diversity and multiplexing gains to suit for varying channel conditions and application requirements. Additionally, its multi-dimensional sequence design provides an extra frequency diversity gain for its further performance improvement.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-2904-7; Electronic:978-1-4799-2903-0; POD:978-1-4799-5385-1","10.1109/ComManTel.2014.6825563","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6825563","","","MIMO communication;code division multiple access;radiofrequency interference;space-time codes;wireless channels","3DCC;chip-level space-time coded CDMA system;diversity advantages;frequency diversity gain;interference-resistant performance;multidimensional sequence design;multiplexing;multiuser MIMO systems;multiuser multiple input multiple output systems;space-time coded signature codes;three dimensional complementary codes;varying channel conditions","","0","","","","","","27-29 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We envision a design flow which incorporates a Formal Specification Level (FSL) thereby bridging the gap between the informal textbook specification and the formal ESL implementation.

In this talk, we will brief y review the WCRE 2000 work and discuss the advances in the field. The WCRE 2000 paper presented a computer assisted clone re-factoring approach. The process was based on metric-based clone analysis that produced clone clusters. Clones in the same cluster were then compared using token-based dynamic programming (DP) matching. Token-based clone differences, which included insertions, deletions, and substitutions, were then projected on to the ASTs corresponding to clones. Re-factoring opportunities were evaluated using: (1) classification of differences involving superficial differences, signature changes, and type changes, (2) number of differences, and (3) size of candidate clones. Selected clones were automatically re-factored using “strategy” and “template” design patterns. Experimental evaluation was performed on JDK1.1.5 from Sun Microsystems. Significant work followed over the next years addressing problems that include matching algorithms, scalability, and integration of clone detection in software engineering activities such as maintenance, evolution, and re-factoring. Several interesting surveys can be found in the literature together with a list of problems, many of which remain open today. In particular, recent work on software clones included new approaches to clone detection based on prefix and suffix trees, approaches to detection involving source code analysis based on latent semantic analysis, and clone identification techniques using analysis of program dependence graphs. In other works, a canonical representation of clones was developed and used for matching and comparison; interesting discussions about harmfulness of clones have also been reported; and empirical studies and evaluations of clone detection approaches can be found in several research papers. Evolution aspects have been taken into consideration- in terms of evolution of clones and their lifetime over several versions of a system and in terms of software evolution by computing various similarity measures between versions. Clone research has also touched upon several interesting applications: intellectual property issues such as license infringement and plagiarism of source code have been addressed using software similarity concepts; incremental approaches to clone detection have been investigated; clones and similarity between structured software artifacts such as trees and graphs has been introduced; detection of bugs caused by inconsistent modifications between clones in a systems and between fragments in several software releases has been investigated; domain specific clones have been studied; and approaches for clone visualization have been proposed. Finally, new specialized workshops and conferences on clones and on mining software repositories have been organized. There are many open problems that remain and possible areas for future work in CLAN (CLone Analysis) toolset including the definition of clones; addressing type III (similar) and simple type IV (semantic) clones; performance and scalability aspects; taxonomies of clones; clone classification and statistics including frequent patterns of similarity in large systems; inconsistent modifications of clones in one version of a system and inconsistent source code changes over several versions of a system leading to a taxonomy of identifiable bugs; clone matching by parallelizing and implementing it on a Graphical Processing Unit (GPU); intellectual property and plagiarism detection using spectral clone analysis; increase recall while maintaining precision; clone maximality issues under thresholds; and more.","1095-1350;10951350","Electronic:978-0-7695-4123-5; POD:978-1-4244-8911-4","10.1109/WCRE.2010.51","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5645476","","","dynamic programming;object-oriented methods;software metrics","advanced clone analysis;clone cluster;clone detection;clone identification;clone maximality;computer assisted clone refactoring;intellectual property;latent semantic analysis;matching algorithm;metric-based clone analysis;plagiarism detection;program dependence graphs;similarity measure;software clone;software engineering;software evolution;software similarity concept;source code analysis;spectral clone analysis;structured software artifact;support object-oriented system refactoring;token-based clone difference;token-based dynamic programming matching","","0","","","","","","13-16 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Yet, the existing reviews report few evidence supporting or refuting the effect of this development approach on test case quality. Lack of ability and skills of developers to produce sufficiently good test cases are also reported as limitations of applying test-driven development in industrial practice. <b>Objective:</b> We investigate the impact of test-driven development on the effectiveness of unit test cases compared to an incremental test last development in an industrial context. <b>Method:</b> We conducted an experiment in an industrial setting with 24 professionals. Professionals followed the two development approaches to implement the tasks. We measure unit test effectiveness in terms of mutation score. We also measure branch and method coverage of test suites to compare our results with the literature. <b>Results:</b> In terms of mutation score, we have found that the test cases written for a test-driven development task have a higher defect detection ability than test cases written for an incremental test-last development task. Subjects wrote test cases that cover more branches on a test-driven development task compared to the other task. However, test cases written for an incremental test-last development task cover more methods than those written for the second task. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our findings are different from previous studies conducted at academic settings. Professionals were able to perform more effective unit testing with test-driven development. Furthermore, we observe that the coverage measure preferred in academic studies reveal different aspects of a development approach. Our results need to be validated in larger industrial contexts.</p>","","","10.1145/3202710.3203153","","","code coverage;empirical study;mutation score;test-driven development;unit testing","","","","","","","","","","","26-27 May 2018","","ACM","ACM Conferences"

Learning classifier systems (LCS) are rule-based evolutionary computing systems and have limited capabilities to handle real valued sparse high-dimensional big data sets. LCS techniques use interval based representations to handle real valued feature vectors. In the work presented here, interval based representation is replaced by genetic programming based tree like structures to classify high-dimensional real valued text feature vectors.

The main challenges for designing of mobile terminal antennas are the compact size requirement of the built-in structure, multiband capabilities, and the number of integrated antennas that form a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) terminal system. Moreover, they are required to fulfill all performance and safety standards. For mobile antennas, their radiation efficiency may be affected by the interaction of user head/hand, which consequently affects the correlation of MIMO antenna systems. This paper provides an overview of user effect on mobile terminal antennas in the last seven years. An overview of the Cellular Telecommunication and Internet Association specifications for mobile terminal antennas will first be explained. This is followed by a discussion on the user’s effects on MIMO parameters, channel capacity on mobile terminal antennas, and millimeter-wave applications prior to the presentation of recent technologies that are aimed at improving the antenna performance.

One form of machine learning - Active Learning - has drawn attention from the legal community because it offers the potential to make the machine learning process even more effective. Active Learning, applied to legal documents, is considered a new technology in the legal domain and is continuously applied to all documents in a legal matter until an insignificant number of relevant documents are left for review. This implementation is slightly different than traditional implementations of Active Learning where the process stops once achieving acceptable model performance. The purpose of this paper is twofold: (i) to question whether Active Learning actually is a superior learning methodology and (ii) to highlight the ways that Active Learning can be most effectively applied to real legal industry data. Unlike other studies, our experiments were performed against large data sets taken from recent, real-world legal matters covering a variety of areas. We conclude that, although these experiments show the Active Learning strategy popularly used in legal document review can quickly identify informative training documents, it becomes less effective over time. In particular, our findings suggest this most popular form of Active Learning in the legal arena, where the highest-scoring documents are selected as training examples, is in fact not the most efficient approach in most instances. Ultimately, a different Active Learning strategy may be best suited to initiate the predictive modeling process but not to continue through the entire document review.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-2715-0; POD:978-1-5386-2716-7; USB:978-1-5386-2714-3","10.1109/BigData.2017.8258076","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8258076","CAL;Continuous Active Learning;Machine Learning;TAR;ediscovery;electronic discovery;predictive coding;technology assisted review;text classification","Electronic mail;Law;Predictive coding;Predictive models;Text categorization;Training","data mining;law;learning (artificial intelligence);text analysis","Active Learning strategy;active learning strategies;document review;legal document review;legal documents;legal matter;machine learning process;real-world legal matters;superior learning methodology","","","","","","","","11-14 Dec. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Design-Induced Latency Variation in Modern DRAM Chips: Characterization, Analysis, and Latency Reduction Mechanisms","D. Lee; S. Khan; L. Subramanian; S. Ghose; R. Ausavarungnirun; G. Pekhimenko; V. Seshadri; O. Mutlu","NVIDIA &#38; Carnegie Mellon University, Austin, TX, USA","ACM SIGMETRICS Performance Evaluation Review","20171207","2017","44","1","54","54","<p>Variation has been shown to exist across the cells within a modern DRAM chip. Prior work has studied and exploited several forms of variation, such as manufacturing-process- or temperature-induced variation. We empirically demonstrate a new form of variation that exists within a real DRAM chip, induced by the design and placement of different components in the DRAM chip: different regions in DRAM, based on their relative distances from the peripheral structures, require different minimum access latencies for reliable operation. In particular, we show that in most real DRAM chips, cells closer to the peripheral structures can be accessed much faster than cells that are farther. We call this phenomenon design-induced variation in DRAM. Our goals are to i) understand design-induced variation that exists in real, state-of-the-art DRAM chips, ii) exploit it to develop low-cost mechanisms that can dynamically find and use the lowest latency at which to operate a DRAM chip reliably, and, thus, iii) improve overall system performance while ensuring reliable system operation. To this end, we first experimentally demonstrate and analyze designed-induced variation in modern DRAM devices by testing and characterizing 96 DIMMs (768 DRAM chips). Our experimental study shows that i) modern DRAM chips exhibit design-induced latency variation in both row and column directions, ii) access latency gradually increases in the row direction within a DRAM cell array (mat) and this pattern repeats in every mat, and iii) some columns require higher latency than others due to the internal hierarchical organization of the DRAM chip.</p> <p>Our characterization identifies DRAM regions that are vulnerable to errors, if operated at lower latency, and finds consistency in their locations across a given DRAM chip generation, due to design-induced variation. Variations in the vertical and horizontal dimensions, together, divide the cell array into heterogeneous-latency regions, where cells in s- me regions require longer access latencies for reliable operation. Reducing the latency uniformly across all regions in DRAM would improve performance, but can introduce failures in the inherently slower regions that require longer access latencies for correct operation. We refer to these inherently slower regions of DRAM as design-induced vulnerable regions.</p> <p>Based on our extensive experimental analysis, we develop two mechanisms that reliably reduce DRAM latency. First, DIVI Profiling uses runtime profiling to dynamically identify the lowest DRAM latency that does not introduce failures. DIVA Profiling exploits design-induced variation and periodically profiles only the vulnerable regions to determine the lowest DRAM latency at low cost. It is the first mechanism to dynamically determine the lowest latency that can be used to operate DRAM reliably. DIVA Profiling reduces the latency of read/write requests by 35.1%/57.8%, respectively, at 55C. Our second mechanism, DIVA Shuffling, shuffles data such that values stored in vulnerable regions are mapped to multiple error-correcting code (ECC) codewords. As a result, DIVA Shuffling can correct 26% more multi-bit errors than conventional ECC. Combined together, our two mechanisms reduce read/write latency by 40.0%/60.5%, which translates to an overall system performance improvement of 14.7%/13.7%/13.8% (in 2-/4-/8-core systems) over a variety of workloads, while ensuring reliable operation.</p>","0163-5999;01635999","","10.1145/3143314.3078533","","","DRAM;fault tolerance;latency variation;memory systems","","","","","","","","","","","June 2017","","ACM","ACM Journals & Magazines"

Zhang","University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA","ACM SIGMETRICS Performance Evaluation Review","20171207","2017","44","1","55","55","<p>In today's data centers, clusters of servers are arranged to perform various tasks in a massively distributed manner: handling web requests, processing scientific data, and running simulations of real-world problems. These clusters are very complex, and require a significant amount of planning and administration to ensure that they perform to their maximum potential. Planning and configuration can be a long and complicated process; once completed it is hard to completely re-architect an existing cluster. In addition to planning the physical hardware, the software must also be properly configured to run on a cluster. Information such as which server is in which rack and the total network bandwidth between rows of racks constrain the placement of jobs scheduled to run on a cluster. Some software may be able to use hints provided by a user about where to schedule jobs, while others may simply place them randomly and hope for the best. Every cluster has at least one bottleneck that constrains the overall performance to less than the optimal that may be achieved on paper. One common bottleneck is the speed of the network: communication between servers in a rack may be unable to saturate their network connections, but traffic flowing between racks or rows in a data center can easily overwhelm the interconnect switches. Various network topologies have been proposed to help mitigate this problem by providing multiple paths between points in the network, but they all suffer from the same fundamental problem: it is cost-prohibitive to build a network that can provide concurrent full network bandwidth between all servers. Researchers have been working on developing new network protocols that can make more efficient use of existing network hardware through a blurring of the line between network layer and applications. One of the most well-known examples of this is Named Data Networking (NDN), a data-centric network architecture that has been in development for - everal years.</p> <p>While NDN has received significant attention for wide-area Internet, a detailed understanding of NDN benefits and challenges in the data center environment has been lacking. The Named Data Networking architecture retrieves content by names rather than connecting to specific hosts. It provides benefits such as highly efficient and resilient content distribution, which fit well to data-intensive distributed computing. This paper presents and discusses our experience in modifying Apache Hadoop, a popular MapReduce framework, to operate on an NDN network. Through this first-of-its-kind implementation process, we demonstrate the feasibility of running an existing, large, and complex piece of distributed software commonly seen in data centers over NDN. We show advantages such as simplified network code and reduced network traffic, which are beneficial in a data center environment. There are also challenges faced by NDN that are being addressed by the community, which can be magnified under data center traffic. Through detailed evaluation, we show a reduction of 16% for overall data transmission between Hadoop nodes while writing data with default replication settings. Preliminary results also show promise for in-network caching of repeated reads in distributed applications. We show that while overall performance is currently slower under NDN, there are challenges and opportunities for further NDN improvements.</p>","0163-5999;01635999","","10.1145/3143314.3078508","","","HADOOP;data centers;emerging technologies;large-scale systems;named data networking","","","","","","","","","","","June 2017","","ACM","ACM Journals & Magazines"

To enhance the quality of the software, number of techniques should be adopted. In the present scenario lots of quantifiable methods/tools are used to measure the various aspects of the software but with the rapid pace of the technology/paradigms. It requires much more effort and research work with the new paradigms. Software metrics measure different attributes of software like size, complexity, reliability, thereby providing useful information about the external quality aspects of software like reusability, maintainability and testability. This paper discusses the evolution of software metrics from traditional function-oriented to object-oriented to component-based to aspect-oriented paradigm along with advantages and limitations of software metrics. As traditional function-oriented metrics lack in quality parameters like reusability, maintainability and so, object-oriented metrics have become one of the popular concepts in today's software development environment. Object-oriented metrics have been widely accepted because of many attributes like reusability, better abstraction, polymorphism, simplicity, time-saving, cost-effectiveness and easy maintenance in the software code. Similarly, component-based and aspect-oriented metrics take this journey forward to achieve these quality aspects in the software more effectively. This paper also describes how these new paradigms help to improve the software quality, system performance and productivity in software development.</p>","","Electronic:978-1-4503-5295-6","10.1145/3133264.3133297","","","Software Metrics;abstraction;aspect-oriented metrics;component-based metrics;function-oriented metrics;object-oriented metrics;polymorphism;reliability;reusability","","","","","","","","","","","25-27 Aug. 2017","","ACM","ACM Conferences"

However, each block in encrypted images has almost the same correlation as that of original images. Therefore, it is required to consider the security from different viewpoints from number theory-based encryption methods with provable security such as RSA and DES. In this paper, existing jigsaw puzzle solvers are first reviewed in terms of attacking strategies on encrypted images.

Between1961 and 1995, eleven sounding-rocket payloads from four countries evolved from proof-of-concept flights to sophisticated instruments. Some involved dual payloads, with the sounder transmitter on one and the sounder receiver on the other. The rocket sounders addressed specific space-plasma-wave questions, and provided improved measurements of ionospheric electron-density (N<inf>e</inf>) field-aligned irregularities (FAI). Four countries launched 12 ionospheric topside-sounder satellites between 1962 and 1994, and an ionospheric sounder was placed on the Mir Space Station in 1998. Eleven magnetospheric radio sounders, most of the relaxation type, were launched from 1977 to 2000. The relaxation sounders used low-power transmitters, designed to stimulate plasma resonances for accurate local N<inf>e</inf> determinations. The latest magnetospheric sounder designed for remote sensing incorporated long antennas and digital signal processing techniques to overcome the challenges posed by low N<inf>e</inf> values and large propagation distances. Three radio sounders from three countries were included on payloads to extraterrestrial destinations from 1990 to 2003. The scientific accomplishments of space-borne radio sounders included (1) a wealth of global N<inf>e</inf> information on the topside ionosphere and magnetosphere, based on vertical and magnetic-field-aligned N<inf>e</inf> profiles; (2) accurate in-situ N<inf>e</inf> values, even under low-density conditions; and (3) fundamental advances in our understanding of the excitation and propagation of plasma waves, which have even led to the prediction of a new plasma-wave mode.","1024-4530;10244530","","10.23919/URSIRSB.2010.7909284","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7909284","","Magnetic resonance imaging;Magnetosphere;Plasmas;Rockets;Satellite broadcasting;Satellites;Space vehicles","","","","","","","","","","June 2010","","URSI","URSI Journals & Magazines"

Browsix comprises two core parts: (1) a JavaScript-only system that makes core Unix features (including pipes, concurrent processes, signals, sockets, and a shared file system) available to web applications; and (2) extended JavaScript runtimes for C, C++, Go, and Node.js that support running programs written in these languages as processes in the browser. Browsix supports running a POSIX shell, making it straightforward to connect applications together via pipes.</p> <p>We illustrate Browsix's capabilities via case studies that demonstrate how it eases porting legacy applications to the browser and enables new functionality. We demonstrate a Browsix-enabled LaTeX editor that operates by executing unmodified versions of pdfLaTeX and BibTeX. This browser-only LaTeX editor can render documents in seconds, making it fast enough to be practical. We further demonstrate how Browsix lets us port a client-server application to run entirely in the browser for disconnected operation. Creating these applications required less than 50 lines of glue code and no code modifications, demonstrating how easily Browsix can be used to build sophisticated web applications from existing parts without modification.</p>","0163-5980;01635980","","10.1145/3093315.3037727","","","browser;browsix;javascript;operating system","","","","","","","","","","","June 2017","","ACM","ACM Journals & Magazines"

Rather than trying to analyze complete binaries and the countless ways their instructions can interact with one another --- memory, side effects, control registers, implicit state, etc. --- we explore a new approach. We propose an architecture controlled by a thin computational layer designed to tightly correspond with the lambda calculus, drawing on principles of functional programming to bring the assembly much closer to myriad reasoning frameworks, such as the Coq proof assistant. This approach allows assembly-level verified versions of critical code to operate safely in tandem with arbitrary code, including imperative and unverified system components, without the need for large supporting trusted computing bases. We demonstrate that this computational layer can be built in such a way as to simultaneously provide full programmability and compact, precise, and complete semantics, while still using hardware resources comparable to normal embedded systems. To demonstrate the practicality of this approach, our FPGA-implemented prototype runs an embedded medical application which monitors and treats life-threatening arrhythmias. Though the system integrates untrusted and imperative components, our architecture allows for the formal verification of multiple properties of the end-to-end system, including a proof of correctness of the assembly-level implementation of the core algorithm, the integrity of trusted data via a non-interference proof, and a guarantee that our prototype meets critical timing requirements.</p>","0163-5980;01635980","","10.1145/3093315.3037733","","","assembly analysis;binary verification;formal methods;functional programming;heterogeneous architecture;isa semantics;non-interference;static analysis","","","","","","","","","","","June 2017","","ACM","ACM Journals & Magazines"

To this end, we perform an in-depth analysis of energy consumption in commercial, off-the-shelf 3D printers from an instruction-level perspective.

The design of Mallacc is quite different from traditional throughput-oriented hardware accelerators. Because memory allocation requests tend to be very frequent, fast, and interspersed inside other application code, accelerators must be optimized for latency rather than throughput and area overheads must be kept to a bare minimum. Mallacc accelerates the three primary operations of a typical memory allocation request: size class computation, retrieval of a free memory block, and sampling of memory usage.

While hardware-assisted CFI enforcement may have the potential for advantages in performance and flexibility over software instrumentation, current hardware-assisted defenses are either incomplete (i.e., do not enforce all control transfers) or less efficient in comparison. We find that the recent introduction of hardware features to log complete control-flow traces, such as Intel Processor Trace (PT), provides an opportunity to explore how efficient and flexible a hardware-assisted CFI enforcement system may become. While Intel PT was designed to aid in offline debugging and failure diagnosis, we explore its effectiveness for online CFI enforcement over unmodified binaries by designing a parallelized method for enforcing various types of CFI policies. We have implemented a prototype called GRIFFIN in the Linux 4.2 kernel that enables complete CFI enforcement over a variety of software, including the Firefox browser and its jitted code. Our experiments show that GRIFFIN can enforce fine-grained CFI policies with shadow stack as recommended by researchers at a performance that is comparable to software-only instrumentation techniques.

Furthermore, REDSPY is capable of identifying values that are approximately the same, enabling optimization opportunities in HPC codes that often use floating point computations. REDSPY provides intuitive optimization guidance by apportioning redundancies to their provenance---source lines and execution calling contexts. REDSPY pinpointed dramatically high volume of redundancies in programs that were optimization targets for decades, such as SPEC CPU2006 suite, Rodinia benchmark, and NWChem---a production computational chemistry code.

Recently, image representations based on the convolutional neural network (CNN) have attracted increasing interest in the community and demonstrated impressive performance. Given this time of rapid evolution, this article provides a comprehensive survey of instance retrieval over the last decade. Two broad categories, SIFT-based and CNN-based methods, are presented. For the former, according to the codebook size, we organize the literature into using large/medium-sized/small codebooks. For the latter, we discuss three lines of methods, i.e., using pre-trained or fine-tuned CNN models, and hybrid methods. The first two perform a single-pass of an image to the network, while the last category employs a patch-based feature extraction scheme. This survey presents milestones in modern instance retrieval, reviews a broad selection of previous works in different categories, and provides insights on the connection between SIFT and CNN-based methods.

The modern power grid requires flexible energy utilization but presents challenges in the case of a high penetration degree of renewable energy, among which wind and solar photovoltaics are typical sources. The integration level of the DPGS into the grid plays a critical role in developing sustainable and resilient power systems, especially with highly intermittent renewable energy resources. To address the challenging issues and, more importantly, to leverage the energy generation, stringent demands from both utility operators and consumers have been imposed on the DPGS.

Currently, these overheads constitute the main bottleneck in the I/O path and they limit efficiency of modern storage systems. In this paper we present a taxonomy of the current state-of-the-art systems on accelerating accesses to fast storage devices. Furthermore, we present Iris, a new I/O path for applications, that minimizes overheads from system software in the common I/O path. The main idea is the separation of the control and data planes. The control plane consists of an unmodified Linux kernel and is responsible for handling data plane initialization and the normal processing path through the kernel for non-file related operations. The data plane is a lightweight mechanism to provide direct access to storage devices with minimum overheads and without sacrificing strong protection semantics. Iris requires neither hardware support from the storage devices nor changes in user applications. We evaluate our early prototype and we find that it achieves on a single core up to 1:7x and 2:2x better read and write random IOPS, respectively, compared to the XFS and EXT4 file systems. It also scales with the number of cores; using 4 cores Iris achieves 1:84x and 1:96x better read and write random IOPS, respectively. In sequential reads we provide similar performance and in sequential writes we are about 20% better compared to other file systems.</p>","0163-5980;01635980","","10.1145/3041710.3041713","","","I/O;NVM;low latency;protection;storage systems","","","","","","","","","","","December 2016","","ACM","ACM Journals & Magazines"

This paper describes a senior-level course that exposes students to foundational characteristics of embedded software, such as concurrency, synchronization and communication. The core of the class is a sequence of laboratory assignments in which students design and implement a real-time operating system. Each student-developed RTOS has the same API, so all can run the same application code, but internal implementations vary widely. The principal challenges that arise in the design and debugging of a multi-tasking RTOS tend to be instances of the general problems that arise in embedded software. In our experience, the activity of creating a working RTOS is effective in helping students acquire the knowledge and skills required to be successful embedded software developers.</p>","","","10.1145/3036686.3036695","","","concurrency;embedded systems;embedded systems education;real-time computing;real-time operating systems;software bugs","","","","","","","","","","","October 2017","","ACM","ACM Journals & Magazines"

A key strategy to encourage rapid prototyping of applications has been to encourage reuse of code using a commodity robot with a standard API along with excellent documentation and training material. An important challenge has been to teach the reasoning process from a design through to an implementation deployed on an actual machine. Model based design is key to articulating such reasoning. A further challenge is to do this in an affordable manner where most available model- based IDEs are expensive proprietary systems using languages such as Esterel and SCADE. We illustrate with a ""Valet Parking"" application how our robotic eco-system facilitates the learning of important model-based design principles taking a high-level specification of a problem down to working code and even deriving test cases in the process. A novel feature of our approach is that we carry out design-time scheduling of various (concurrent) activities by analyzing dependencies between modules and obtain purely sequential C-code implemented on a microcontroller without the need for an RTOS. This case study is an exemplar of a model-based design approach for a large class of such robotic projects.</p>","","","10.1145/3036686.3036691","","","UML;design time scheduling;educational robot;model based design;model based testing;project based learning;state machines","","","","","","","","","","","October 2017","","ACM","ACM Journals & Magazines"

However, the existing transmission schemes do not seriously consider the problem of real-time video multicast to a cluster of co-located multihomed mobile devices. Conventionally, each client fetches the video streaming to the best of its capability, and this results in competing resources that degrade user-perceived video quality. Several literatures investigated the problem of using cellular to obtain video contents from the remote server and sharing them through WiFi. However, the stringent delay constraint of real-time video is not addressed in these solutions. In this paper, a cooperative transmission scheme is proposed to tackle the problem. First, a mathematical framework dubbed (Group-Aware Delay-COnstraint) is developed to formulate the delay-constrained goodput maximization problem of real-time video transmission to a group of - ultihomed mobiles. Second, a dataflow distribution mechanism is presented to conserve the cellular bandwidth and maximize user experience. Then, a prototype is implemented on the Android platform involving real-time video encoded with H.264 codec. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme achieves appreciable improvements over the reference schemes in video peak signal-to-noise ratio, end-to-end delay, and goodput.","","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2671900","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; National High Technology Research and Development Program of China (863 Program); 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7859328","Video transmission;delay constraint;device-to-device communications;multihoming","Delays;IEEE 802.11 Standard;Mobile communication;Notice of Violation;Real-time systems;Servers;Smart phones;Streaming media","cellular radio;cooperative communication;data communication;multicast communication;optimisation;pattern clustering;smart phones;video coding;video communication;video streaming;wireless LAN","Android platform;H.264 codec;Wi-Fi;cellular bandwidth conservation;concurrent data transmission;cooperative transmission scheme;dataflow distribution mechanism;end-to-end delay;goodput;group-aware delay-constrained video transmission;mathematical framework;multihomed device-to-device network;multihomed mobile device cluster;radio interface;real-time video encoding;real-time video multicast;real-time video stringent delay constraint;real-time video transmission delay-constrained goodput maximization problem;remote server;user experience maximization;user-perceived video quality;video content;video peak signal-to-noise ratio;video streaming;wireless communication system","","","","","","","20170220","2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Several solutions relying on operating system (OS) threads perfectly work with a moderate number of cores. However, exascale systems will spawn hundreds of thousands of threads in order to exploit their massive parallel architectures and thus conventional OS threads are too heavy for that purpose. Several lightweight thread (LWT) libraries have recently appeared offering lighter mechanisms to tackle massive concurrency. In order to examine the suitability of LWTs in high-level runtimes, we develop a set of microbenchmarks consisting of commonly-found patterns in current parallel codes. Moreover, we study the semantics offered by some LWT libraries in order to expose the similarities between different LWT application programming interfaces. This study reveals that a reduced set of LWT functions can be sufficient to cover the common parallel code patterns andthat those LWT libraries perform better than OS threads-based solutions in cases where task and nested parallelism are becoming more popular with new architectures.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-3653-0; POD:978-1-5090-3654-7","10.1109/CLUSTER.2016.12","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7776544","Lightweight Threads;OpenMP;Programming Models","Concurrent computing;Hardware;Instruction sets;Libraries;Message systems;Semantics;Synchronization","application program interfaces;multi-threading;multiprocessing systems;operating systems (computers);parallel architectures;software libraries","LWT application programming interfaces;LWT functions;LWT libraries;high performance computing;high-level directive-based solutions;high-level runtimes;lightweight thread approaches;lightweight thread libraries;many-core architectures;massive concurrency;multicore architectures;operating system threads;parallel code patterns;parallel codes","","2","","","","","","12-16 Sept. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Using a representative implementation based on LTE OFDM MIMO systems, extensive link-level and system-level performance simulations are carried out, which demonstrate that SWCM offers significant gains for all users over conventional interference-aware communication schemes. Network operating prerequisites for SWCM are also discussed to facilitate the standardization effort for its adoption in the fifth generation cellular network.","0163-6804;01636804","","10.1109/MCOM.2016.1600356CM","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7744815","","Binary phase shift keying;Interference;Iterative decoding;MIMO;Maximum likelihood decoding;Receivers","5G mobile communication;Long Term Evolution;OFDM modulation;cellular radio;interference suppression;maximum likelihood decoding;radiofrequency interference","5G cellular network;LTE OFDM MIMO system;SWCM scheme;extensive link level;fifth generation cellular network;interference adverse effect mitigation;interference management;interference-aware communication scheme;low-complexity decoding;minimal coordination overhead;network information theory principle;optimal maximum likelihood decoding performance;physical layer;representative implementation;sliding-window coded modulation;standardization effort;system-level performance simulation","","1","","","","","","November 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, these devices pose a unique set of challenges to application developers who lack both hardware and software support tools. Energy harvesting devices experience power intermittence which causes the system to reset and power-cycle unpredictably, tens to hundreds of times per second. This can result in code execution errors that are not possible in continuously-powered systems and cannot be diagnosed with conventional debugging tools such as JTAG and/or oscilloscopes. We propose the Energy-interference-free Debugger, a hardware and software platform for monitoring and debugging intermittent systems without adversely effecting their energy state. The Energy-interference-free Debugger re-creates a familiar debugging environment for intermittent software and augments it with debugging primitives for effective diagnosis of intermittence bugs. Our evaluation of the Energy-interference-free Debugger quantifies its energy-interference-freedom and shows its value in a set of debugging tasks in complex test programs and several real applications, including RFID code and a machine-learning-based activity recognition system.</p>","0163-5980;01635980","","10.1145/2954680.2872409","","","energy-harvesting","","","","","","","","","","","June 2016","","ACM","ACM Journals & Magazines"

To address this issue, in this paper we propose Noisy Bloom Filter (NBF) and Error Corrected Noisy Bloom Filter (NBF-E) for multi-set membership testing. For theoretical analysis, we optimize their classification failure rate and false positive rate, and present criteria for selection between NBF and NBF-E. The key novelty of NBF and NBF-E is to store set ID information in a compact but noisy way that allows fast recording and querying, and use denoising method for querying. Especially, NBF-E incorporates asymmetric error-correcting coding technique into NBF to enhance the resilience of query results to noise by revealing and leveraging the asymmetric error nature of query results. To evaluate NBF and NBF-E in comparison with prior art, we conducted experiments using real-world network traces.

We build hardware prototypes of the above designs that can be powered solely using harvested energy from TV and solar sources.

Today, the monolithic architecture of a kernel is the main factor undermining its security, and even worse, limiting its evolution towards a safer, more secure environment. Lack of isolation across kernel subsystems allows attackers to take control over the entire machine with a single kernel vulnerability. Furthermore, complex, semantically rich monolithic code with globally shared data structures and no explicit interfaces is not amenable to formal analysis and verification tools. Even after decades of work to make monolithic kernels more secure, over a hundred serious kernel vulnerabilities are still reported every year.</p> <p>Modern kernels need decomposition as a practical means of confining the effects of individual attacks. Historically, decomposed kernels were prohibitively slow. Today, the complexity of a modern kernel prevents a trivial decomposition effort. We argue, however, that despite all odds modern kernels can be decomposed. Careful choice of communication abstractions and execution model, a general approach to decomposition, a path for incremental adoption, and automation through proper language tools can address complexity of decomposition and performance overheads of decomposed kernels. Our work on lightweight capability domains (LCDs) develops principles, mechanisms, and tools that enable incremental, practical decomposition of a modern operating system kerne.</p>","0163-5980;01635980","","10.1145/2883591.2883601","","","Linux;decomposition;microkernels","","","","","","","","","","","December 2015","","ACM","ACM Journals & Magazines"

Recovering lost packets is particularly challenging in multicast scenarios since different receivers lose different packets. For this reason, simply retransmitting packets does not scale well with the number of receivers and particularly with the packet loss rate. A more efficient alternative is to use erasure codes to generate packets that can help many receivers at the same time. In this paper, we propose using online network coding to send coded packets that repair losses according to feedback reports sent by the clients. In particular, we propose using a recently developed scheduler for controlling feedback reports, which also allows differentiating the QoS provided to clients, and combine it with an online coding approach to provide novel stochastic guarantees of worst-case delay as required for QoS sensitive applications. We show preliminary simulation results that confirm the bounded decoding delay of our approach in a streaming application.</p>","","","10.1145/2815482.2815492","","","","","","","","2","","","","","","June 2015","","ACM","ACM Journals & Magazines"

The present study seeks to apply the PSD-model with regard to this major issue in eHealth. A comprehensive literature search was conducted using the databases Web of Knowledge, EBSCOHOST, Picarta, Scopus and ScienceDirect. The following characteristics were coded: Health care domain, Study level, Sample size, Intended usage, Usage web-based intervention, Adherence, Predictors of adherence, Intervention, Interaction, Persuasive technology in the intervention. The search yielded 4939 unique titles, of which 460 articles were deemed relevant. After title, abstract and full text screening by two researchers, 109 articles were included. Concluding, we can say that it seems that when designing web-based interventions, most attention is given to support the primary task. Dialogue support and social support appear neglected. Taking into account that more extensive use of persuasive technology seems to be positively related to adherence, more attention should be paid to all forms of support through technology.</p>","","","10.1145/2467803.2467806","","","adherence;eHealth;persuasive technology;systematic review","","","","","1","","","","","","2-5 June 2011","","ACM","ACM Conferences"

Yet at the same time, it leads to major challenges like limited control of third party infrastructures and runtime changes which mostly cannot be foreseen during development. While previous research focused on automated adaptation, increased complexity and heterogeneity of cloud services as well as their limited observability, makes evident that we need to allow operators (humans) to engage in the adaptation process. Models are useful for involving humans and conducting analysis, e.g. for performance and privacy. During operation the systems often drifts away from its design-time models. Run-time models are kept insync with the underlying system. However, typical run-time models are close to an implementation level of abstraction which impedes understandability for humans. In this vision paper, we present the iObserve approach to target aforementioned challenges while considering operationlevel adaptation and development-level evolution as two mutual interwoven processes. Central to this perception is an architectural run-time model that is usable for automatized adaptation and is simultaneously comprehensible for humans during evolution. The run-time model builds upon a technology-independent monitoring approach. A correspondence model maintains the semantic relationships between monitoring outcomes and architecture models. As an umbrella a megamodel integrates design-time models, code generation, monitoring, and run-time model update. Currently, iObserve covers the monitoring and analysis phases of the MAPE control loop. We come up with a roadmap to include planning and execution activities in iObserve.</p>","0163-5999;01635999","","10.1145/2897356.2897359","","","Architectural Run-time Model;Palladio Component Model;Performance Model;Privacy;Usage Profile","","","","","4","","","","","","March 2016","","ACM","ACM Journals & Magazines"

Automating code variant selection typically relies on machine learning to construct a model during an offline learning phase that can be quickly queried at runtime once the execution context is known. In this paper, we define a new approach called architecture-adaptive code variant tuning, where the variant selection model is learned on a set of source architectures, and then used to predict variants on a new target architecture without having to repeat the training process. We pose this as a multi-task learning problem, where each source architecture corresponds to a task; we use device features in the construction of the variant selection model.

They often use erasure codes to protect against disk and node failures to increase reliability, while trying to meet the latency requirements of the applications and clients. This paper provides an insightful upper bound on the average service delay of such erasure-coded storage with arbitrary service time distribution and consisting of multiple heterogeneous files. Not only does the result supersede known delay bounds that only work for homogeneous files, it also enables a novel problem of joint latency and storage cost minimization over three dimensions: selecting the erasure code, placement of encoded chunks, and optimizing scheduling policy. The problem is efficiently solved via the computation of a sequence of convex approximations with provable convergence. We further prototype our solution in an open-source, cloud storage deployment over three geographically distributed data centers. Experimental results validate our theoretical delay analysis and show significant latency reduction, providing valuable insights into the proposed latency-cost tradeoff in erasure-coded storage.</p>","0163-5999;01635999","","10.1145/2667522.2667524","","","","","","","","5","","","","","","September 2014","","ACM","ACM Journals & Magazines"

Through measurement-based analysis, we find that adapting all available 802.11n features results in higher goodput than adapting only a subset of features, thereby showing that holistic link adaptation is crucial to achieve best performance. We then design a novel hybrid link adaptation scheme termed SampleLite that adapts all 802.11n features while being efficient compared to sampling-based open-loop schemes and practical relative to closed loop schemes. SampleLite uses sender-side RSSI measurements to significantly lower the sampling overhead, by exploiting the monotonic relationship between best settings for each feature and the RSSI. Through analysis and experimentation in a testbed environment, we show that our proposed approach can reduce the sampling overhead by over 70% on average compared to the widely used Minstrel HT scheme. We also experimentally evaluate the goodput performance of SampleLite in a wide range of controlled and real-world interference scenarios. Our results show that SampleLite, while performing close to the ideal, delivers goodput that is 35-100% better than with existing schemes.</p>","0146-4833;01464833","","10.1145/2766330.2766332","","","802.11n;algorithms;design;experimentation;link adaptation;performance","","","","","6","","","","","","April 2015","","ACM","ACM Journals & Magazines"

Network coding is one of the promising techniques at the communication layer in which multiple messages are opportunistically encoded into a single message to reduce the number of transmissions. While network coding is a theoretically promising technique, its benefit in energy efficiency depends on the practical overheads associated with various computations such as encoding, decoding, and the coding opportunity algorithm itself. Analytical and simulation-based studies are often inadequate to sufficiently evaluate the effectiveness of network coding. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a wireless testbed for the purpose of energy-aware resource management in networked embedded systems.

Recent studies have shown serious security concerns due to ""rowhammer"" attacks, where repeated accesses to a row of memory cause bit flips in adjacent rows. Recent work by Google's Project Zero has shown how to leverage rowhammer-induced bit-flips as the basis for security exploits that include malicious code injection and memory privilege escalation. Being an important security concern, industry has attempted to defend against rowhammer attacks. Deployed defenses employ two strategies: (1) doubling the system DRAM refresh rate and (2) restricting access to the <i>CLFLUSH</i> instruction that attackers use to bypass the cache to increase memory access frequency (i.e., the rate of rowhammering). We demonstrate that such defenses are inadequte: we implement rowhammer attacks that both avoid using the <i>CLFLUSH</i> instruction and cause bit flips with a doubled refresh rate. Our next-generation <i>CLFLUSH-free</i> rowhammer attack bypasses the cache by manipulating cache replacement state to allow frequent misses out of the last-level cache to DRAM rows of our choosing.</p> <p>To protect existing systems from more advanced rowhammer attacks, we develop a <i>software-based</i> defense, ANVIL, which thwarts all known rowhammer attacks on existing systems. ANVIL detects rowhammer attacks by tracking the locality of DRAM accesses using existing hardware performance counters. Our detector identifies the rows being frequently accessed (i.e., the aggressors), then selectively refreshes the nearby victim rows to prevent hammering. Experiments running on real hardware with the SPEC2006 benchmarks show that ANVIL has less than a 1% false positive rate and an average slowdown of 1%. ANVIL is low-cost and robust, and our experiments indicate that it is an effective approach for protecting existing and future systems from even advanced rowhammer attacks.</p>","0163-5980;01635980","","10.1145/2954680.2872390","","","CLFLUSH;DRAM;bit-plru;disturbance errors;intel pebs;kernel module;performance counters;rowhammer","","","","","","","","","","","June 2016","","ACM","ACM Journals & Magazines"

Of significant interest are Behavioral Specialized Accelerators (BSAs), which are designed to efficiently execute code with only certain properties, but remain largely configurable or programmable. The most important strength of BSAs -- their ability to target a wide variety of codes -- also makes their interactions and analysis complex, raising the following questions: can multiple BSAs be composed synergistically, what are their interactions with the general purpose core, and what combinations favor which workloads? From a methodological standpoint, BSAs are also challenging, as they each require ISA development, compiler and assembler extensions, and either simulator or RTL models.</p> <p>To study the potential of BSAs, we propose a novel modeling technique called the Transformable Dependence Graph (TDG) - a higher level alternative to the time-consuming traditional compiler+simulator approach, while still enabling detailed microarchitectural models for both general cores and accelerators. We then propose a multi-BSA organization, called ExoCore, which we model and study using the TDG. A design space exploration reveals that an ExoCore organization can push designs beyond the established energy-performance frontiers for general purpose cores.

RAID schemes define various drive array organizations (denoted as RAID levels) that can be used in arrays of hard disk drives (HDDs) and arrays of NAND flash memory solid-state drives (SSDs). For larger drive arrays, using data striping with erasure coding is appealing due to its notably higher space efficiency compared to data replication. However, the main issue of data striping with erasure coding is the performance of random writes smaller than a stripe. This problem is even aggravated if the random access performance characteristics of the deployed device type (HDD or SSD) and device model are not properly considered when choosing the data striping configuration (in particular the stripe unit size).</p> <p>In this article, we provide an analytical model allowing to predict the random write throughput of homogeneous drive arrays as well as of a heterogeneous drive array with code blocks stored on the faster drives. Based on our model, we develop a method to improve the random write throughput in homogeneous drive arrays (comprising only one device type, e.g., HDDs or SSDs) by adapting the data striping configuration to the used device type and model in relation to the workload. Then, based on our previous work, we describe an organization for heterogeneous drive arrays, which is especially suitable for arrays combining HDDs with SSDs, and permits to further increase the random write throughput by storing data blocks on slower and code blocks on faster drives. Finally, we experimentally evaluate our analytical claims and show that random write throughput can indeed be notably increased in drive arrays that use data striping with erasure coding.</p>","1559-6915;15596915","","10.1145/2893706.2893709","","","RAID;data striping;erasure coding;hard disk drives;heterogeneous data storage systems;solid-state drives","","","","","","","","","","","December 2015","","ACM","ACM Journals & Magazines"

Quality is a measure of the extent to which a TAR method achieves this objective, while reliability is a measure of how consistently it achieves an acceptable result. We are concerned with how to define, measure, and achieve high quality and high reliability in TAR. When quality is defined using the traditional goal-post method of specifying a minimum acceptable recall threshold, the quality and reliability of a TAR method are both, by definition, equal to the probability of achieving the threshold. Assuming this definition of quality and reliability, we show how to augment any TAR method to achieve guaranteed reliability, for a quantifiable level of additional review effort. We demonstrate this result by augmenting the TAR method supplied as the baseline model implementation for the TREC 2015 Total Recall Track, measuring reliability and effort for 555 topics from eight test collections. While our empirical results corroborate our claim of guaranteed reliability, we observe that the augmentation strategy may entail disproportionate effort, especially when the number of relevant documents is low. To address this limitation, we propose stopping criteria for the model implementation that may be applied with no additional review effort, while achieving empirical reliability that compares favorably to the provably reliable method. We further argue that optimizing reliability according to the traditional goal-post method is inconsistent with certain subjective aspects of quality, and that optimizing a Taguchi quality loss function may be more apt.</p>","","","10.1145/2911451.2911510","","","continuous active learning;e-discovery;electronic discovery;predictive coding;quality;relevance feedback;reliability;systematic review;technology-assisted review;test collections","","","","","","","","","","","17-21 July 2016","","ACM","ACM Conferences"

However, for the sake of scalability, in the feedback phase a scheduler bounds the maximum number of clients that can communicate feedback in each given cycle and schedules them. Moreover, using a shorter or longer feedback phase also impacts on the number of simultaneous clients in feedback mode, resulting in more or less impact of the scheduler and more or less effectiveness of the feedback itself. In this short paper we briefly describe a recently developed prototype and we summarize some preliminary results confirming the advantage of using scheduled feedback.

Language features, such as code abstraction and parallel control structures, map well to pattern-matching problems, providing clarity and maintainability.

In brief, Datix manages to efficiently answer queries within minutes compared to more than 24 hours processing when executing existing Python based code in single node setups. Datix also achieves nearly 70% speedup compared to baseline query implementations of popular big data analytics engines such as Hive and Shark.</p>","0146-4833;01464833","","10.1145/2831347.2831351","","","hadoop;hbase;k-d tree;map-join;mapreduce;sflow","","","","","1","","","","","","October 2015","","ACM","ACM Journals & Magazines"
"How to Build Static Checking Systems Using Orders of Magnitude Less Code","F. Brown; A. Nötzli; D. Engler","Stanford University, Stanford , CA, USA","ACM SIGOPS Operating Systems Review","20161111","2016","50","2","143","157","<p>Modern static bug finding tools are complex. They typically consist of hundreds of thousands of lines of code, and most of them are wedded to one language (or even one compiler). This complexity makes the systems hard to understand, hard to debug, and hard to retarget to new languages, thereby dramatically limiting their scope. This paper reduces checking system complexity by addressing a fundamental assumption, the assumption that checkers must depend on a full-blown language specification and compiler front end. Instead, our program checkers are based on drastically incomplete language grammars (""micro-grammars"") that describe only portions of a language relevant to a checker. As a result, our implementation is tiny-roughly 2500 lines of code, about two orders of magnitude smaller than a typical system. We hope that this dramatic increase in simplicity will allow people to use more checkers on more systems in more languages.</p> <p>We implement our approach in μchex, a language-agnostic framework for writing static bug checkers. We use it to build micro-grammar based checkers for six languages (C, the C preprocessor, C++, Java, JavaScript, and Dart) and find over 700 errors in real-world projects.</p>","0163-5980;01635980","","10.1145/2954680.2872364","","","bug finding;micro-grammars;parsing;static analysis","","","","","","","","","","","June 2016","","ACM","ACM Journals & Magazines"

These codes however mandate much higher resources with respect to network bandwidth and disk IO during reconstruction of data that is missing or otherwise unavailable. Existing solutions to this problem either demand additional storage space or severely limit the choice of the system parameters. In this paper, we present ""Hitchhiker"", a new erasure-coded storage system that reduces both network traffic and disk IO by around 25% to 45% during reconstruction of missing or otherwise unavailable data, with no additional storage, the same fault tolerance, and arbitrary flexibility in the choice of parameters, as compared to RS-based systems. Hitchhiker 'rides' on top of RS codes, and is based on novel encoding and decoding techniques that will be presented in this paper. We have implemented Hitchhiker in the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). When evaluating various metrics on the data-warehouse cluster in production at Facebook with real-time traffic and workloads, during reconstruction, we observe a 36% reduction in the computation time and a 32% reduction in the data read time, in addition to the 35% reduction in network traffic and disk IO. Hitchhiker can thus reduce the latency of degraded reads and perform faster recovery from failed or decommissioned machines.</p>","0146-4833;01464833","","10.1145/2740070.2626325","","","degraded reads;disk IO;distributed storage;erasure codes;fault tolerance;network traffic;recovery","","","","","13","3","","","","","October 2014","","ACM","ACM Journals & Magazines"

Superoptimization can, in principle, discover machine-specific optimizations automatically by searching the space of all instruction sequences. If we can increase the size of code fragments a superoptimizer can optimize, we will be able to discover more optimizations. We develop LENS, a search algorithm that increases the size of code a superoptimizer can synthesize by rapidly pruning away invalid candidate programs. Pruning is achieved by selectively refining the abstraction under which candidates are considered equivalent, only in the promising part of the candidate space. LENS also uses a bidirectional search strategy to prune the candidate space from both forward and backward directions. These pruning strategies allow LENS to solve twice as many benchmarks as existing enumerative search algorithms, while LENS is about 11-times faster.</p> <p>Additionally, we increase the effective size of the superoptimized fragments by relaxing the correctness condition using contexts (surrounding code). Finally, we combine LENS with complementary search techniques into a cooperative superoptimizer, which exploits the stochastic search to make random jumps in a large candidate space, and a symbolic (SAT-solver-based) search to synthesize arbitrary constants. While existing superoptimizers consistently solve 9--16 out of 32 benchmarks, the cooperative superoptimizer solves 29 benchmarks. It can synthesize code fragments that are up to 82% faster than code generated by gcc -O3 from WiBench and MiBench.</p>","0163-5980;01635980","","10.1145/2954680.2872387","","","SMT;program synthesis;superoptimization","","","","","","","","","","","June 2016","","ACM","ACM Journals & Magazines"

We argue that: 1. hiding heterogeneity behind a common hardware interface unifies, to a large extent, the control and coordination of cores and accelerators in the OS, 2. isolating at the network-on-chip rather than with processor features (like privileged mode, memory management unit, ...), allows running untrusted code on arbitrary cores, and 3. providing OS services via protocols over the network-on-chip, instead of via system calls, makes them accessible to arbitrary types of cores as well.</p> <p>In summary, this turns accelerators into first-class citizens and enables a single and convenient programming environment for all cores without the need to trust any application.</p> <p>In this paper, we introduce network-on-chip-level isolation, present the design of our microkernel-based OS, M3, and the common hardware interface, and evaluate the performance of our prototype in comparison to Linux.

However, their compression efficiency is still insufficient for certain domains where a plethora of video data should be archived. One example is the domain of medical endoscopy where entire surgeries are recorded for documentation with high visual quality because it is not possible to anticipate if and when exceptional situations may happen. Eventually, only a fraction of the video footage is of actual relevance for post-operative review. In this paper, we introduce the concept of domain-specific video compression by the example of this very specific domain. We identify several characteristics of endoscopic surgery videos that can be exploited by content-based analysis algorithms to achieve a significantly higher compression efficiency than in current practice. The extensive evaluation shows that the proposed methods massively reduce the data volume without any semantic information loss and thus allow for long-term video archiving of endoscopic surgery videos.

The notion of regularity comes from generic programming and C++. Programmers routinely rely on regularity when reasoning about generic code and manually performing (optimizing) code transformations and rewrites. Stepanov suggests that compilers, too, should take advantage of regularity to expand the opportunities for applying optimizing transformations. This paper exploits the properties of regular composite objects to produce concise procedure summaries for summary-based analyses, thus taking a step towards Stepanov's goal. In addition to regularity and compositeness, we also make our analysis aware of the prevalent ""iterator"" abstraction, which expands the applicability of our approach.

Semantic conflicts may result in programming errors that are difficult to detect and costly to resolve. This paper presents in-depth analyses of representative collaborative programming scenarios for understanding the nature and general conditions of semantic conflicts, and proposes a novel <i>Dependency-based Automatic Locking</i> (DAL) approach for supporting semantic conflict prevention in real-time collaborative programming environments. The novelty of the DAL approach lies in its capabilities of supporting automatic and fine-grained locking on selected source code regions with dependency relationships to balance conflict prevention, concurrent work, and programmer convenience in real-time collaborative programming. The DAL approach and technical solutions have been implemented in the <i>CoEclipse</i> prototype system as a proof-of-concept for this emerging technique, which is being continuously extended for further exploration and evaluation.</p>","1559-6915;15596915","","10.1145/2340416.2340420","","","conflict prevention;dependency graph;dependency relationship;locking;locking state maintenance;real-time collaborative programming;semantic conflict;semantic consistency","","","","","1","","","","","","2012","","ACM","ACM Journals & Magazines"

In most cases, these protocols are designed for specific type of networks and they perform well in their best case, for example, HOP performs well in mesh networks but would incur unnecessary overhead in wired networks . For supporting these different protocols across the Internet, all hosts need to have implementation of multiple transport protocols running. The application layer can then ask for a specific transport protocol as required. Since the transport layer is typically built in the operating system of most static and mobile communication end points, most protocols cannot be supported on legacy networks. This paper proposes ByPass, a transport layer protocol which alleviates the need for implementing different transport protocols. We present ByPass as an unified transport layer protocol that can switch modes according to variation in the network type to provide steady performance guarantee. For a network with unstable wireless links, it will switch to a hop-by-hop reliable mode and when the links are steady, it will switch to an end-to-end reliable mode. Using the ByPass framework API, application layer can be completely agnostic of the transport approach thus allowing common application code to be written across different types of network.</p>","1559-1662;15591662","","10.1145/2436196.2436198","","","","","","","","","","","","","","October 2012","","ACM","ACM Journals & Magazines"

A major problem that has challenged this vision is that backscatter communication is neither reliable nor efficient. Backscatter nodes cannot sense each other, and hence tend to suffer from colliding transmissions. Further, they are ineffective at adapting the bit rate to channel conditions, and thus miss opportunities to increase throughput, or transmit above capacity causing errors.</p> <p> This paper introduces a new approach to backscatter communication. The key idea is to treat all nodes as if they were a single virtual sender. One can then view collisions as a code across the bits transmitted by the nodes. By ensuring only a few nodes collide at any time, we make collisions act as a <i>sparse code</i> and decode them using a new customized compressive sensing algorithm. Further, we can make these collisions act as a <i>rateless code</i> to automatically adapt the bit rate to channel quality --i.e., nodes can keep colliding until the base station has collected enough collisions to decode. Results from a network of backscatter nodes communicating with a USRP backscatter base station demonstrate that the new design produces a 3.5× throughput gain, and due to its rateless code, reduces message loss rate in challenging scenarios from 50% to zero.</p>","0146-4833;01464833","","10.1145/2377677.2377685","","","backscatter;compressive sensing;rfid;wireless","","","","","15","1","","","","","October 2012","","ACM","ACM Journals & Magazines"

However, due to the predominance of IPv4 in the Internet, the transition to IPv6 is likely to take a long time. During the transition period, translation mechanisms will enable IPv6 hosts and IPv4 hosts to communicate with each other. For example, translation can be used when a server or application works with IPv4 but not with IPv6, and the effort or cost to modify the code is large. Stateless and stateful translation is the subject of several recent IETF RFCs. We evaluate performance of the new IVI translator, which is viewed as a design for stateless translation by conducting experiments in both LAN and Internet environments using a freely available Linux implementation of IVI. To study the impact of operating system overhead on IVI translation, we implemented the IVI translator on a bare PC that runs applications without an operating system or kernel. Our results based on internal timings in each system show that translating IPv4 packets into IPv6 packets is more expensive than the reverse, and that address mapping is the most expensive IVI operation. We also measured packets per second in the LAN, roundtrip times in the LAN and Internet, IVI overhead for various prefix sizes, TCP connection time, and the delay and throughput over the Internet for various files sizes. While both the Linux and bare PC implementations of IVI have low overhead, a modest performance gain is obtained due to using a bare PC.</p>","1559-6915;15596915","","10.1145/2460136.2460138","","","IPv4-IPv6 transition;IPv6;IVI translation;Linux;bare PC","","","","","2","","","","","","March 2013","","ACM","ACM Journals & Magazines"

We focus our attention on the popular Trickle algorithm, which has been proposed as a suitable communication protocol for code maintenance and propagation in wireless sensor networks. Besides providing a mathematical analysis of the algorithm, we propose a generalized version of Trickle, with an additional parameter defining the length of a listen-only period. This generalization proves to be useful for optimizing the design and usage of the algorithm. For single-cell networks we show how the message count increases with the size of the network and how this depends on the Trickle parameters. Furthermore, we derive distributions of inter-broadcasting times and investigate their asymptotic behavior.

In this paper, we propose a novel performance inference system, called IntroPerf, that generates fine-grained performance information -- like that from application profiling tools -- transparently by leveraging OS tracers that are widely available in most commodity operating systems. With system stack traces as input, IntroPerf enables transparent context-sensitive performance inference, and diagnoses application performance in a multi-layered scope ranging from user functions to the kernel. Evaluated with various performance bugs in multiple open source software projects, IntroPerf automatically ranks potential internal and external root causes of performance bugs with high accuracy without any prior knowledge about or instrumentation on the subject software.

Unfortunately, compared to a plethora of work in software and hardware directed code/data optimizations, much less effort has been spent in understanding the fundamental characteristics of data access patterns exhibited by application programs and their interaction with the underlying cache hardware. Therefore, in general it is hard to reason about cache behavior of a program running on a target system. Motivated by this observation, we first set up a ""locality model"" that can help us determine the theoretical bounds of the cache misses caused by irregular data accesses. We then explain how this locality model can be used for different data locality optimization purposes. After that, based on our model, we propose a data reordering (data layout reorganization) scheme that can be applied after any existing data reordering schemes for irregular applications to improve cache performance by further reducing the cache misses.

Network coded routing, in which a node combines messages from different sources, has been shown to increase reliability in the presence of link failures with small additional overhead. A drawback of network coded routing is the lack of a natural stopping condition to control the dissemination of data. We describe an enhanced coding router that uses the mathematical structure of the orthogonal complement, or nullspace, as an improved stopping condition to eliminate redundant transmissions, and an additional technique to balance multiple coded data flows. These changes are incorporated into the DTN2 Reference Implementation and evaluated in two types of experiments. In a simple data-mule scenario, our EBR router comes very close to perfect efficiency.

These phenomena are resultant of the workload features and the adopted scheduling algorithms. Analytically understanding the delays under different schedulers for MapReduce can facilitate the design and deployment of large Hadoop clusters. The map and reduce tasks of a MapReduce job have fundamental difference and tight dependence between them, complicating the analysis. This also leads to an interesting starvation problem with the widely used Fair Scheduler due to its greedy approach to launching reduce tasks. To address this issue, we design and implement Coupling Scheduler, which gradually launches reduce tasks depending on map task progresses. Real experiments demonstrate improvements to job response times by up to an order of magnitude.</p> <p>Based on extensive measurements and source code investigations, we propose analytical models for the default FIFO and Fair Scheduler as well as our implemented Coupling Scheduler. For a class of heavy-tailed map service time distributions, i.e., regularly varying of index -a, we derive the distribution tail of the job processing delay under the three schedulers, respectively. The default FIFO Scheduler causes the delay to be regularly varying of index -a+1. Interestingly, we discover a criticality phenomenon for Fair Scheduler, the delay under which can change from regularly varying of index -a to -a+1, depending on the maximum number of reduce tasks of a job. Other more subtle behaviors also exist. In contrast, the delay distribution tail under Coupling Scheduler can be one order lower than Fair Scheduler under some conditions, implying a better performance.</p>","0163-5999;01635999","","10.1145/2318857.2254761","","","MapReduce;coupling scheduler;fair scheduler;first in first out;hadoop;heavy-tails;processor sharing","","","","","5","","","","","","June 2012","","ACM","ACM Journals & Magazines"

The key idea in the code is the sequential application of a pseudo-random hash function to the message bits to produce a sequence of coded symbols for transmission. This encoding ensures that two input messages that differ in even one bit lead to very different coded sequences after the point at which they differ, providing good resilience to noise and bit errors. To decode spinal codes, this paper develops an approximate maximum-likelihood decoder, called the <i>bubble decoder</i>, which runs in time polynomial in the message size and achieves the Shannon capacity over both additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and binary symmetric channel (BSC) models. Experimental results obtained from a software implementation of a linear-time decoder show that spinal codes achieve higher throughput than fixed-rate LDPC codes, rateless Raptor codes, and the layered rateless coding approach of Strider, across a range of channel conditions and message sizes.

Mutlu","Carnegie Mellon University &#38; Intel Labs, Pittsburgh, USA","ACM SIGMETRICS Performance Evaluation Review","20160129","2014","42","1","519","532","<p>As DRAM cells continue to shrink, they become more susceptible to retention failures. DRAM cells that permanently exhibit short retention times are fairly easy to identify and repair through the use of memory tests and row and column redundancy. However, the retention time of many cells may vary over time due to a property called <i>Variable Retention Time (VRT)</i>. Since these cells intermittently transition between failing and non-failing states, they are particularly difficult to identify through memory tests alone. In addition, the high temperature packaging process may aggravate this problem as the susceptibility of cells to VRT increases after the assembly of DRAM chips. A promising alternative to manufacture-time testing is to detect and mitigate retention failures after the system has become operational. Such a system would require mechanisms to detect and mitigate retention failures in the field, but would be responsive to retention failures introduced after system assembly and could dramatically reduce the cost of testing, enabling much longer tests than are practical with manufacturer testing equipment.</p> <p>In this paper, we analyze the efficacy of three common error mitigation techniques (memory tests, guardbands, and error correcting codes (ECC)) in real DRAM chips exhibiting both intermittent and permanent retention failures. Our analysis allows us to quantify the efficacy of recent system-level error mitigation mechanisms that build upon these techniques. We revisit prior works in the context of the experimental data we present, showing that our measured results significantly impact these works' conclusions. We find that mitigation techniques that rely on run-time testing alone [38, 27, 50, 26] are unable to ensure reliable operation even after many months of testing. Techniques that incorporate ECC[4, 52], however, can ensure reliable DRAM operation after only a few hours of testing. For example, VS-ECC[4], which couples testing with variabl- strength codes to allocate the strongest codes to the most error-prone memory regions, can ensure reliable operation for 10 years after only 19 minutes of testing. We conclude that the viability of these mitigation techniques depend on efficient online profiling of DRAM performed without disrupting system operation.</p>","0163-5999;01635999","","10.1145/2637364.2592000","","","dram;ecc;error correction;fault tolerance;memory scaling;retention failures;system-level detection and mitigation","","","","","7","","","","","","June 2014","","ACM","ACM Journals & Magazines"

In particular, exploitations of BOF might lead to many unwanted consequences including denial of service through program crash, control flow hijacking, and corrupted program state. When BOF vulnerabilities are detected, they need to be patched before the software is redeployed. Source level automatic patching of vulnerabilities has the challenges of finding a set of general rules and consistently applying them without bringing any side effects to intended software. This paper proposes a set of general rules to address the mitigation of BOF vulnerabilities for C/C++ programs. In particular, we developed a set of rules to identify vulnerable code and how to make the code vulnerability free. The proposed rule-based approach addresses both simple (one statement) and complex (multiple statements) forms of code that can be vulnerable to BOF ranging from unsafe library function calls to the pointer usage in control flow structures (loop and conditional statements). We evaluated the proposed approach using two publicly available benchmarks and a number of open source C/C++ applications. The results show that the proposed rules can not only identify previously known BOF vulnerabilities, but also find new vulnerabilities. Moreover, the patching rules impose negligible overhead to the application.</p>","1559-6915;15596915","","10.1145/2505420.2505421","","","buffer overflow;pointer usage;rule-based patching;software vulnerability;unsafe library function calls","","","","","3","","","","","","June 2013","","ACM","ACM Journals & Magazines"

They however can provide such measurements only when there are no insertion and deletion errors, which could occur in various wireless network environments. In this work, we propose ``idEEC'', the first technique that can do so even in the presence of insertion and deletion errors. We show that idEEC is provable robust under most bit insertion and deletion scenarios, provided insertion/deletion errors occur with much lower probability than bit flipping errors. Our idEEC design can build upon any existing EEC scheme. The basic idea of the idEEC encoding is to divide the packet into a number of segments, each of which is encoded using the underlying EEC scheme. The basic idea of the idEEC decoding is to divide the packet into a few slices in a randomized manner -- each of which may contain several segments -- and then try to identify a slice that has no insertion and deletion errors in it (called a ``clean slice''). Once such a clean slice is found, it is removed from the packet for later processing, and this ``randomized divide and search'' procedure will be iteratively performed on the rest of the packet until no more clean slices can be found. The BER will then be estimated from all the clean slices discovered through all the iterations. A careful analysis of the accuracy guarantees of the idEEC decoding is provided, and the efficacy of idEEC is further validated by simulation experiments.</p>","0163-5999;01635999","","10.1145/2637364.2591976","","","deletion channel;error estimating coding;insertion channel","","","","","","","","","","","June 2014","","ACM","ACM Journals & Magazines"

It is an extended version of a paper that was published in SAC'13 Proceedings of the 2013 ACM Symposium on Applied Computing, in which additional details about <i>SimPal</i> as well as a more extensive evaluation of the framework is presented. The objective is to identify necessary quality properties and to learn more about the challenges of realizing frameworks such as SimPal. We approach our research questions by developing a framework and by analysing our experiences from the design and evaluation process. Some necessary quality characteristics has been identified by discussing the ISO25010 <i>quality in use</i> quality model in relation to the problem domain, which were then used to design and evaluate the developed framework. The evaluation was conducted as a design case in which a <i>soft safety controller</i> was developed following the methodology outlined in the paper. We show that our approach, which tries to merge service-oriented practices with model-based development techniques, has potential considering safety-critical software development. However, there are some concerns about run-time performance as well as the ability to qualify the tool for safety-critical development. Based on our results we conclude that the ideas behind the <i>SimPal</i> framework are sound but more work is required to investigate how they can be realized. For the future, we plan on further investigating the code generating capabilities of the modelling tool we are using to see if and how it can be utilised to increase performance. We also plan on adding more features to the framework, for instance coordination and configuration of services, as well as monitoring of messages and system properties.</p>","1559-6915;15596915","","10.1145/2577554.2577558","","","frameworks and tools;real-time systems;safety-critical development;service-oriented computing;verification","","","","","","","","","","","December 2013","","ACM","ACM Journals & Magazines"

To distinguish between different potential stored values, conventional techniques to read data from flash memory employ a single set of reference voltage values, which are determined based on the overall threshold voltage distribution of flash cells. Unfortunately, the phenomenon of program interference, in which a cell's threshold voltage unintentionally changes when a neighboring cell is programmed, makes this conventional approach increasingly inaccurate in determining the values of cells.</p> <p>This paper makes the new empirical observation that identifying the value stored in the immediate-neighbor cell makes it easier to determine the data value stored in the cell that is being read. We provide a detailed statistical and experimental characterization of threshold voltage distribution of flash memory cells <i>conditional upon</i> the immediate-neighbor cell values, and show that such conditional distributions can be used to determine a set of read reference voltages that lead to error rates much lower than when a single set of reference voltage values based on the overall distribution are used. Based on our analyses, we propose a new method for correcting errors in a flash memory page, neighbor-cell assisted correction (NAC). The key idea is to re-read a flash memory page that fails error correction codes (ECC) with the set of read reference voltage values corresponding to the conditional threshold voltage distribution assuming a neighbor cell value and use the re-read values to correct the cells that have neighbors with that value. Our simulations show that NAC effectively improves flash memory lifetime by 33% while having no (at nominal lifetime) or very modest (less than 5% at extended lifetime) performance overhead.</p>","0163-5999;01635999","","10.1145/2637364.2591994","","","ecc;error correction;fault tolerance;nand flash memory;program interference;threshold voltage distribution","","","","","4","","","","","","June 2014","","ACM","ACM Journals & Magazines"

Our comparison addresses a central question in the deployment of technology-assisted review: Should training documents be selected at random, or should they be selected using one or more non-random methods, such as keyword search or active learning? On eight review tasks -- four derived from the TREC 2009 Legal Track and four derived from actual legal matters -- recall was measured as a function of human review effort. The results show that entirely non-random training methods, in which the initial training documents are selected using a simple keyword search, and subsequent training documents are selected by active learning, require substantially and significantly less human review effort (P<0.01) to achieve any given level of recall, than passive learning, in which the machine-learning algorithm plays no role in the selection of training documents. Among passive-learning methods, significantly less human review effort (P<0.01) is required when keywords are used instead of random sampling to select the initial training documents. Among active-learning methods, continuous active learning with relevance feedback yields generally superior results to simple active learning with uncertainty sampling, while avoiding the vexing issue of ""stabilization"" -- determining when training is adequate, and therefore may stop.</p>","","","10.1145/2600428.2609601","","","e-discovery;electronic discovery;predictive coding;technology-assisted review","","","","","1","","","","","","6-11 July 2014","","ACM","ACM Conferences"

Additive inter-user interference at the receivers is an important physical layer characteristic of wireless networks. Today's Wi-Fi networks are based upon the abstraction of physical layer where inter-user interference is considered as noise leading to the 'collision' model in which users are required to co-ordinate their transmissions through Carrier Sensing Multiple Access (CSMA)-based schemes to avoid interference. This, in turn, leads to an inherent performance trade-off [1]: it is impossible to obtain high throughput and low delay by means of low complexity medium access algorithm (unless P=NP). As the main result, we establish that this trade-off is primarily due to treating interference as noise in the current wireless architecture. Concretely, we develop a simple medium access algorithm that allows for simultaneous transmissions of users to the same receiver by performing joint decoding at receivers, over time. For a receiver to be able to decode multiple transmissions quickly enough, we develop appropriate congestion control where each transmitter maintains a ""window"" of undecoded transmitted data that is adjusted based upon the ""feedback"" from the receiver. In summary, this provides an efficient, low complexity ""online"" code operating at varying rate, and the system as a whole experiences only small amount of delay (including decoding time) while operating at high throughput.</p>","0163-5999;01635999","","10.1145/2318857.2254812","","","complexity;congestion control;delay;medium access;throughput","","","","","","","","","","","June 2012","","ACM","ACM Journals & Magazines"

But benchmark creation is a tedious manual process. As a result, benchmarks tend to lag behind the development of complex scientific codes. Our work automates the creation of communication benchmarks. Given an MPI application, we utilize ScalaTrace, a lossless and scalable framework to trace communication operations and execution time while abstracting away the computations. A single trace file that reflects the behavior of all nodes is subsequently expanded to C source code by a novel code generator. This resulting benchmark code is compact, portable, human-readable, and accurately reflects the original application's communication characteristics and performance. Experimental results demonstrate that generated source code of benchmarks preserves both the communication patterns and the run-time behavior of the original application. Such automatically generated benchmarks not only shorten the transition from application development to benchmark extraction but also facilitate code obfuscation, which is essential for benchmark extraction from commercial and restricted applications. </p>","0163-5999;01635999","","10.1145/2381056.2381078","","","ScalaTrace;communication benchmark;performance;trace compression","","","","","1","","","","","","September 2012","","ACM","ACM Journals & Magazines"

Code stability is a recently introduced measurement technique that has been used to determine the impact of code cloning by quantifying the changeability of a code region. Although most existing stability analysis studies agree that cloned code is more stable than non-cloned code, the studies have two major flaws: (i) each study only considered a single stability measurement (e.g., lines of code changed, frequency of change, age of change); and, (ii) only a small number of subject systems were analyzed and these were of limited variety.</p> <p>In this paper, we present a comprehensive empirical study on code stability using four different stability measuring methods. We use a recently introduced hybrid clone detection tool, NiCAD, to detect the clones and analyze their stability in different dimensions: by clone type, by measuring method, by programming language, and by system size and age. Our in-depth investigation on 12 diverse subject systems written in three programming languages considering three types of clones reveals that: (i) cloned code is generally less stable than non-cloned code, and more specifically both Type-1 and Type-2 clones show higher instability than Type-3 clones; (ii) clones in both Java and C systems exhibit higher instability compared to the clones in C# systems; (iii) a system's development strategy might play a key role in defining its comparative code stability scenario; and, (iv) cloned and non-cloned regions of a subject system do not follow any consistent change pattern.</p>","1559-6915;15596915","","10.1145/2387358.2387360","","","changeability;code stability;modification frequency;overall instability;software clones;types of clones","","","","","10","","","","","","September 2012","","ACM","ACM Journals & Magazines"

Such applications have made data a valuable resource that needs to be provided appropriate security. High value associated with big data sets has rendered big data storage systems attractive targets for cyber attackers, whose goal is to compromise the Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability of data and information. Common defense strategy for protecting cyber assets has been to first take preventive measures, and if these fail, detecting intrusions and finally recovery. Unfortunately, attackers have developed tremendous technical sophistication to defeat most defensive mechanisms. Alternative strategy is to design architectures which are intrinsically attack tolerant. This paper describes a technique that involves eliminating single point of security failures through fragmentation, coding, dispersion and reassembly. It is shown that this technique can be successfully applied to routing, networked storage systems, and big data file systems to make them attack tolerant.</p>","0163-5999;01635999","","10.1145/2627534.2627556","","","attack tolerance;big-data security;data availability;data confidentiality;data integrity;secure storage","","","","","","","","","","","March 2014","","ACM","ACM Journals & Magazines"

Unlike conventional distributed systems, the timeliness characteristics of dynamic and hybrid distributed systems may vary over time, according to the availability of resources and occurrence of failures. Such systems are becoming common today because of the increasing diversity and heterogeneity of computer networks and associated devices.

We first summarize a list of key challenges and opportunities in high mobility communication systems, then provide comprehensive reviews of techniques that can address these challenges and utilize the unique opportunities. The review covers a wide spectrum of communication operations, including the accurate modeling of high mobility channels, the transceiver structures that can exploit the properties of high mobility environments, the signal processing techniques that can harvest the benefits (e.g., Doppler diversity) and mitigate the impairments (e.g., carrier frequency offset, intercarrier interference, channel estimation errors) in high mobility systems, and the mobility management and network architectures that are designed specifically for high mobility systems. The survey focuses primarily on physical layer operations, which are affected the most by the mobile environment, with some additional discussions on higher layer operations, such as handover management and control-plane/user-plane decoupling, which are essential to high mobility operations.

As a counterpart in machine learning, the modification of connection strength (weight) endows artificial neural networks with a powerful learning capability to solve various problems. Independent of modification for synaptic strength, recent experimental results have revealed that a single neuron also has the ability to change its intrinsic excitability to fit the synaptic input. This mechanism is referred to as neuronal intrinsic plasticity (IP) in the literature. Computational learning rules for IP have been developed based on the hypothesis of information maximization with a stable response level. With the discovery of this novel plasticity mechanism, a series of studies has focused on how IP plays a role in biological neural systems and how they benefit the learning performance of artificial neural networks. In this review, corresponding research on synergies between IP and synaptic plasticity mechanisms is presented in both the computational modeling of biological neural systems and the applications of artificial neural networks, and this combination in artificial learning systems is defined as synergistic learning.","","","10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2509005","National Program for Special Support of Eminent Professionals; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7358047","Intrinsic plasticity;artificial neural networks;homeostasis;machine learning;sparse coding;synaptic plasticity;synergistic learning","Computational modeling;Hebbian theory;IP networks;Learning systems;Neuroscience;Synergistic learning","learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets","artificial learning systems;artificial neural networks;biological neural systems;machine learning;neural mechanism;neuronal intrinsic plasticity;synaptic plasticity;synergistic learning","","2","","111","","","20151217","2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

While the low power networks provide energy optimised solution for Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications and interaction between the smart entities, there are also some concerns around the conventional video encoding and streaming mechanisms suitability in such networks. In this paper we review widely adopted video encoders such as MPEG and H.264 and assess their suitability for the low power networks within different video streaming scenarios. In previous work we considered video steaming in low power networks related challenges and elicited a number of possible recommendations based on specific requirements associated with IoT.

Also, we present further discussions on the previously identified issues and provide some evaluation results assessing the viability of our recommendations.

Data Privacy is one of the major challenges when users outsource their data to a cloud computing system. Privacy can be violated by the cloud vendor, vendor's authorized users, other cloud users, unauthorized users, or external malicious entities. Encryption is one of the solutions to protect and maintain privacy of cloud-stored data. However, encryption methods are complex and expensive for mobile devices. In this paper, we propose a new light-weight method for mobile clients to store data on one or multiple clouds by using pseudo-random permutation based on chaos systems. The proposed method can be used in the client mobile devices to store data in the cloud(s) without using cloud computing resources for encryption to maintain user's privacy. We consider JPEG image format as a case study to present and evaluate the proposed method. Our experimental results show that the proposed method achieve superior performance compared to over encryption methods, such as AES and encryption on JPEG encoders while protecting the mobile user data privacy. We review major security attack scenarios against the proposed method that shows the level of security.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-8977-5; POD:978-1-4799-8978-2","10.1109/MobileCloud.2015.36","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7130886","Chaos System;Data storage;JPEG encryption;Mobile Cloud Computing;Permutation;Privacy","Chaos;Cloud computing;Data privacy;Encryption;Mobile communication;Mobile handsets;Transform coding","authorisation;cloud computing;cryptography;data privacy;image coding;mobile computing;mobile handsets","AES;JPEG encoders;JPEG image format;cloud computing paradigm;cloud users;cloud vendor;cloud-stored data;data privacy;encryption methods;external malicious entities;light-weight method;light-weight permutation based method;mobile clients;mobile cloud computing;mobile devices;privacy maintain;security attack scenarios;unauthorized users;vendor authorized users;virtual IT infrastructures","","8","","24","","","","March 30 2015-April 3 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This article reviews various OOBE reduction techniques and proposes a generalized low-complexity OOBE reduction framework for discrete Fourier transform precoded OFDM.

This situation poses serious challenges to genomic data storage and transferring. It is desirable to compress data to reduce storage and transferring cost, and thus to boost data distribution and utilization efficiency. Up to now, a number of algorithms / tools have been developed for compressing genomic sequences. Unlike the existing algorithms, most of which treat genomes as one-dimensional text strings and compress them based on dictionaries or probability models, this paper proposes a novel approach called CoGI (the abbreviation of Compressing Genomes as an Image) for genome compression, which transforms the genomic sequences to a two-dimensional binary image (or bitmap), then applies a rectangular partition coding algorithm to compress the binary image. CoGI can be used as either a reference-based compressor or a reference-free compressor. For the former, we develop two entropy-based algorithms to select a proper reference genome. Performance evaluation is conducted on various genomes. Experimental results show that the reference-based CoGI significantly outperforms two state-of-the-art reference-based genome compressors GReEn and RLZ-opt in both compression ratio and compression efficiency. It also achieves comparable compression ratio but two orders of magnitude higher compression efficiency in comparison with XM-one state-of-the-art reference-free genome compressor. Furthermore, our approach performs much better than Gzip-a general-purpose and widely-used compressor, in both compression speed and compression ratio. So, CoGI can serve as an effective and practical genome compressor.

Earlier image encryption techniques like AES,DES,RSA etc. exhibit low levels of security and also weak anti attack ability. This problem was overcome by using chaos based cryptography.

A traditional view of neural information processing suggests that neurons compute in a highly parallel and distributed manner, in which the cooperation of many weak synaptic inputs is necessary to activate a single neuron. Recent experiments, however, have shown that not all synapses are weak in cortical circuits, but some synapses are extremely strong (several tens of times larger than the average weight). In fact, the weights of excitatory synapses between cortical excitatory neurons often obey a lognormal distribution with a long tail of strong synapses. Here, we review some of our important and recent works on computation with sparsely distributed synaptic weights and discuss the possible implications of this synaptic principle for neural computation by spiking neurons. We demonstrate that internal noise emerges from long-tailed distributions of synaptic weights to produce stochastic resonance effect in the reverberating synaptic pathways constituted by strong synapses. We show a spike-timing-dependent plasticity rule and other mechanisms that produce such weight distributions. A possible hardware realization of lognormally connected networks is also shown.","0018-9219;00189219","","10.1109/JPROC.2014.2306254","; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6767040","Associative memory (AM);feedforward networks;network connectivity;neural dynamics;neuromorphic engineering;principal component analysis (PCA);recurrent networks;sparse coding;spike sequence;spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP);stochastic resonance","Biological neural networks;Integrated circuit modeling;Memory;Neurons;Noise measurement;Principal component analysis;Stability analysis;Stochastic resonance;Stochastic systems","bioelectric potentials;brain;log normal distribution;medical computing;neural nets;neurophysiology;stochastic processes","brain;computational implications;connectivity structure;cortical circuits;cortical excitatory neurons;distributed computation;excitatory synapse weights;graph structure;hardware realization;internal noise;lognormal distribution;long-tailed distributions;neural computation;neural information processing;neural network structure;parallel computation;reverberating synaptic pathways;single neuron;sparsely distributed synaptic weights;spike-timing-dependent plasticity rule;spiking neurons;stochastic resonance effect;strong synapses;synaptic connection;synaptic principle;weak synaptic inputs;weight distribution;weight structure","","7","","56","","","20140314","April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper we present a novel idea to reduce manual review efforts by identifying redundancy in this review process. We propose two partitioning techniques to identify redundant warnings - 1) partitioning of the warnings with each partition having one leader warning such that if the leader is a false positive, so are all the warnings in its partition which need not be reviewed and 2) further partitioning the leader warnings based on similarity of the modification points of variables referred to in their expressions. The second technique makes the review process faster by identifying further redundancies and it also makes the reviewing of a warning easier due to the associated information of modification points. Empirical results obtained with these grouping techniques indicate that, on an average, 60% of warnings are redundant in the review context and skipping their review would lead to a reduction of 50-60% in manual review efforts.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-5739-5; POD:978-1-4673-5738-8","10.1109/SCAM.2013.6648191","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6648191","Analysis Warnings;Data Flow Analysis;False Positives;Review of Warnings;Static Analysis","Arrays;Conferences;Equations;Indexes;Manuals;Maximum likelihood estimation;Redundancy","data flow analysis;program verification","data flow analysis;generated warnings;grouping techniques;leader warnings;modification points similarity;redundant warning identification;review efforts reduction;software verification;static analysis warnings partitioning","","8","","19","","","","22-23 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Results show that only a small subset of software fault types, affecting a restricted collection of statements, is related to security. To understand how these vulnerabilities are really exploited by hackers, this paper also presents an analysis of the source code of the scripts used to attack them. The outcomes of this study can be used to train software developers and code inspectors in the detection of such faults and are also the foundation for the research of realistic vulnerability and attack injectors that can be used to assess security mechanisms, such as intrusion detection systems, vulnerability scanners, and static code analyzers.","1545-5971;15455971","","10.1109/TDSC.2013.37","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6589556","Internet applications;Security;languages;review and evaluation","Awards activities;Blogs;Internet;Java;Security;Software","Internet;SQL;security of data;software fault tolerance;source code (software)","SQL injection;Web application vulnerabilities;Web security vulnerabilities;XSS;attack injectors;code inspectors;field data analysis;intrusion detection systems;realistic vulnerability;security mechanisms;security patches;software faults;source code;static code analyzers;vulnerability scanners","","8","","56","","","20130906","March-April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

These caches rely on the fault maps (which grow reciprocally with smaller word sizes) for fault identification. Therefore, the benefits of cache voltage scaling must be rigorously investigated against the cost of their fault map overheads, especially in large caches. This paper reviews the word substitution caches and develops their parametric failure model. Our developed model leads to a non-intrusive and reconfigurable cache (Macho) which can be locally optimized (based on local fault density) by two graph-based algorithms. Specifically, our adaptive matching algorithm increases effective cache capacity by dynamically concentrating healthy cache blocks into active cache sets. Macho enables voltage scaling down to 400mV by tolerating high SRAM-failure rates (≥ 1%) and achieves better energy reduction (44%) than other substitution caches with similar area overheads.","1530-0897;15300897","Electronic:978-1-4673-5587-2; POD:978-1-4673-5585-8","10.1109/HPCA.2013.6522347","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6522347","","Adaptation models;Circuit faults;Error correction codes;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Mathematical model;Random access memory","CMOS memory circuits;SRAM chips;cache storage;failure analysis;graph theory;memory architecture;pattern matching;power aware computing;reconfigurable architectures","CMOS voltage scaling;Macho;SRAM-failure rates;adaptive matching algorithm;cache capacity;cache voltage scaling;energy reduction;failure model-oriented adaptive cache architecture;fault identification;fault maps;faulty words;graph-based algorithms;healthy cache blocks;local fault density;near-threshold voltage scaling;nonintrusive cache;parametric SRAM failures;reconfigurable cache;word substitution caches","","9","","20","","","","23-27 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Benchmarking the FIT rate of caches due to soft errors is critical to evaluate the relative merits of a plethora of protection schemes that are being proposed to protect against soft errors. The benchmarking of cache reliability introduces a unique challenge as compared to internal processor storage structures, such as the load/store queue. In the case of internal processor structures the time a data bit resides in the structure is so short that it is generally safe to assume that no more than one soft error strike can occur. Thus the reliability of such structures is overwhelmingly dominated by single bit errors. By contrast, a memory block may reside for millions of cycles in a last level cache. In this case it is important to consider the impact of the spatial and temporal distribution of multiple errors within the lifetime of a cache block in the presence of error protection.</p> <p>This paper introduces a unified reliability benchmarking framework called PARMA (Precise Analytical Reliability Model for Architecture). PARMA is a rigorous analytical framework that accurately accounts for the distribution of multiple errors to measure the failure rate under any protection scheme. In a single simulation run PARMA provides a precise FIT rate (expected number of failures in one billion hours) measurement for storage structures where the effect of multiple errors cannot be neglected. We have implemented the PARMA framework on top of a cycle-accurate out-of-order processor simulator (sim-outorder) to benchmark L2 cache failure rates for a set of CPU 2000 benchmarks. The effectiveness of three protection schemes are compared in terms of L2 cache FIT rate: parity, word-level Single Error Correcting Double Error Detecting (SECDED) code and block-level SECDED.</p> <p>Exploiting the accuracy of PARMA, we demonstrate that current te- hniques to evaluate cache FIT rates in the presence of SECDED, such as accelerated fault injection simulations and first-principle derivations based on Architectural Vulnerability Factor (AVF), can overestimate FIT rates by vast amounts. Based on the insights gained during this research we also introduce a new approximate analytical model that can quickly and more accurately estimate cache FIT rate in the presence of SECDED.</p>","0163-5999;01635999","","10.1145/2007116.2007127","","","cache;reliability;soft error","","","","","0","7","","","","","June 2011","","ACM","ACM Journals & Magazines"

The stochastic modeling is a powerful tool that helps the analysis and optimization of stochastic systems.</p> <p>However the use of stochastic modeling is not widely spread in today's industries and among practitioners. This lack of acceptance is caused by two main reasons the first being the curse of dimensionality, which is defined by the number of states required to describe a system. This number grows exponentially as the size of the system increases. The second reason is the lack of user-friendly and efficient software packages that allow the modeling of the problem without involving the user with the implementation of the solution algorithms to solve it.</p> <p>The curse of dimensionality is a constant problem that has been addressed by different approaches through time, but it is not intended within the scope of our work; our focus is on the latter issue. We propose a generic solver that enables the user to focus on modeling without getting involved in the complexity required by the solution methods.</p> <p>We design an object oriented framework for stochastic modeling with four components namely, jMarkov which models Markov Chains, jQBD which models Quasi Birth and Death Processes, jPhase which models Phase Types Distributions and jMDP which models Markov Decision Processes. We concentrate all our effort on creating a software that allows the user to model any kind of system like a Markov Chain, QBD or MDP with fairly basic knowledge of programming. To this end we separate the modeling part from the solution algorithms; therefore the user only needs to mathematically model the problem and the software will do the rest. However, we leave the package with the possibility that experienced users can code their own solution algorithms; this is done since the package onl- contains the most common algorithms found in the literature.</p> <p>The software does not use external plain files like '.txt' or '.dat' written with specific commands, but rather it is based on OOP (Object Oriented Programming). The main advantages of it include implementation in Java framework, which allows the computational representation of the model to be very similar to its mathematical representation such that it would become natural to pass from one to another. Also the program possesses the usual characteristics of Java such as the use of inheritance and abstraction. Finally, Java is a high level computational language so the user doesn't need to be concerned about technical problems.</p>","0163-5999;01635999","","10.1145/2185395.2185439","","","","","","","","0","","","","","","April 2012","","ACM","ACM Journals & Magazines"

Further, movement of massive amounts (Terabytes to Petabytes) of data is very expensive, which necessitates affinity driven computations. Therefore, distributed scheduling of parallel computations on multiple places 1 needs to optimize multiple performance objectives: follow affinity maximally and ensure efficient space, time and message complexity. Simultaneous consideration of these objectives makes distributed scheduling a particularly challenging problem. In addition, parallel computations have data dependent execution patterns which requires online scheduling to effectively optimize the computation orchestration as it unfolds.</p> <p>This paper presents an online algorithm for affinity driven distributed scheduling of multi-place 2 parallel computations. To optimize multiple performance objectives simultaneously, our algorithm uses a low time and message complexity mechanism for ensuring affinity and a randomized work-stealing mechanism within places for load balancing. Theoretical analysis of the expected and probabilistic lower and upper bounds on time and message complexity of this algorithm has been provided. On multi-core clusters such as Blue Gene/P (MPP architecture) and Intel multicore cluster, we demonstrate performance close to the custom MPI+Pthreads code. Further, strong, weak and data (increasing input data size) scalability have been demonstrated on multi-core clusters. Using well known benchmarks, we demonstrate 16% to 30% performance gain as compared to Cilk [6] on multi-core Intel Xeon 5570 (NUMA) architecture. Detailed experimental analysis illustrates efficient space (main memory) utilization as well.

This article presents a Design and Evaluation Framework for defect-tolerant Cache Memories (DEFCAM), which enables processor architects to consider yield, area, and performance together in a unified framework. Since there is a complex, changing trade-off among these metrics depending on the technology, the cache organization, and the yield enhancement scheme employed, such a design flow is invaluable to processor architects when they assess a design and explore the design space quickly at an early stage. We develop a complete framework supporting the proposed DEFCAM design flow, from injecting defects into a wafer to evaluating program performance of individual processors on the wafer. Using DEFCAM, interesting interactions between architectural, organizational, and layout/defect related parameters can be easily evaluated. Moreover, we propose practical set remapping schemes to contain hard faults in cache memory. In a set remapping scheme, accesses that would go to an unusable faulty set are directed to a sound set. Case studies are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design flow and developed tools. Experimental results show that a set remapping is the most efficient fault covering method among prevailing strategies.</p>","1544-3566;15443566","","10.1145/2019608.2019616","","","Process Variations;Yield","","","","","2","","","","","","October 2011","","ACM","ACM Journals & Magazines"

Further, the NCD can be applied to symbolic data and raw signals alike. In this paper we decompose the NCD and introduce a method to measure compression-based similarity without the need to use compression.

In this paper, we propose Membrane, a set of changes to the operating system to support restartable file systems. Membrane allows an operating system to tolerate a broad class of file system failures and does so while remaining transparent to running applications; upon failure, the file system restarts, its state is restored, and pending application requests are serviced as if no failure had occurred. Our initial evaluation ofMembrane with ext2 shows thatMembrane induces little performance overhead and can tolerate a wide range of file system crashes.

In addition, false positives from automated analysis will not likely disappear, and remediation measures and candidate fix tests will need to be evaluated. We present Zinsight, a visual and analytic tool that supports performance analysts and debugging, using large event traces to understand complex systems. This tool enables analysts to quickly create and manipulate high-level structural representations linked with statistical analysis derived from the underlying event trace data. The original raw trace is annotated with module names and a domain specific database is incorporated to relate software functions to module names. Navigable sequence context graph views present automatically extracted execution flow patterns from arbitrarily definable sets of events and are linked to frequency, distribution, and response time views. The goal is to reduce the cognitive and computational load on the analyst while providing answers to the most natural questions in a problem determination session. We present a case study of the tool in use on field problems from the recently shipped (late 2008) IBM z10 mainframe.

An understanding of locality effects and communication behavior can provide programmers with valuable information about performance bottlenecks and opportunities for optimization. Unfortunately, most performance analyses are architecture dependent, and hence insights gleaned from an application's behavior on one platform may not apply when the application is run on another. In this position paper, we argue that what is needed are architecture independent metrics that characterize the behavior of an application in a system-agnostic manner. Such metrics will allow a program's performance to be analyzed across a range of architectures without incurring the overhead of repeated profiling and analysis.

Chunk-based deduplication, which breaks up data objects into single-instance chunks that can be shared across objects, is an effective method for saving storage space. However, deduplication affects data reliability because an object's constituent chunks are often spread across a large number of disks, potentially decreasing the object's reliability. Therefore, an important problem in deduplicated storage is how to achieve space efficiency yet maintain each object's original reliability. In this paper, we present initial results on the reliability analysis of HP-KVS, a deduplicated key-value store that allows each object to specify its own reliability level and that uses software erasure coding for data reliability. The combination of deduplication and erasure coding gives rise to several interesting research problems. We show how to compare the reliability of erasure codes with different parameters and how to analyze the reliability of a big data object given its constituent parts' reliabilities. We also present a method for system designers to determine under what conditions deduplication will save space for erasure-coded data.</p>","0163-5999;01635999","","10.1145/1925019.1925021","","","","","","","","6","6","","","","","December 2010","","ACM","ACM Journals & Magazines"

With recent chips capable of executing up to 32 tasks in parallel, this rate of growth also shows no sign of slowing. Alongside the development of denser micro-processors has been the considerably more modest rate of improvement in random access memory (RAM). The effect has been that the available memory-per-core has reduced and current projections suggest that this is set to reduce still further.</p> <p>In this paper we present three studies into the use and measurement of memory in parallel applications; our aim is to capture, understand and, if possible, reduce the memory-per-core needed by complete multi-component applications. First, we present benchmarked memory usage and runtimes of a six scientific benchmarks, which represent algorithms that are common to a host of production-grade codes. Memory usage of each benchmark is measured and reported for a variety of compiler toolkits, and we show >30% variation in memory high-water mark requirements between compilers. Second, we utilise this benchmark data combined with runtime data, to simulate via the Maui scheduler simulator, the effect on a multi-science workow if memory-per-core is reduced from 1.5GB-per-core to only 256MB. Finally, we present initial results from a new memory profiling tool currently in development at the University of Warwick.

In other words, if the application is misbehaving, it is little consolation that it is doing so quickly or power-efficiently. In the Log-Based Architectures (LBA) project, we are focusing on a challenging source of application misbehavior: software bugs, including obscure bugs that only cause problems during security attacks. To help detect and fix software bugs, we have been exploring techniques for accelerating dynamic program monitoring tools, which we call ""lifeguards"". Lifeguards are typically written today using dynamic binary instrumentation frameworks such as Valgrind or Pin. Due to the overheads of binary instrumentation, lifeguards that require instructiongrain information typically experience 30X-100X slowdowns, and hence it is only practical to use them during explicit debug cycles. The goal in the LBA project is to reduce these overheads to the point where lifeguards can run continuously on deployed code. To accomplish this, we propose hardware mechanisms to create a dynamic log of instruction-level events in the monitored application and stream this information to one or more software lifeguards running on separate cores on the same multicore processor. In this paper, we highlight techniques and features of LBA that reduce the slowdown to just 2%--51% for sequential programs and 28%--51% for parallel programs.</p>","0163-5980;01635980","","10.1145/1945023.1945034","","","lifeguards;log-based architectures;parallel monitoring;program monitoring;software bugs","","","","","1","1","","","","","January 2011","","ACM","ACM Journals & Magazines"

To enhance the data availability, some form of redundancy is used. For example, conventional RAID-5 systems provide data availability for single disk failure only, while recent advanced coding techniques such as row-diagonal parity (RDP) can provide data availability with up to two disk failures. To reduce the probability of data unavailability, whenever a single disk fails, disk recovery (or rebuild) will be carried out. We show that conventional recovery scheme of RDP code for a single disk failure is inefficient and suboptimal. In this paper, we propose an optimal and efficient disk recovery scheme, Row-Diagonal Optimal Recovery (RDOR), for single disk failure of RDP code that has the following properties: (1) it is read optimal in the sense that it issues the smallest number of disk reads to recover the failed disk; (2) it has the load balancing property that all surviving disks will be subjected to the same amount of additional workload in rebuilding the failed disk. We carefully explore the design state space and theoretically show the optimality of RDOR.

For instance, they can enable users to access reviews or price comparisons for a product from a picture of its barcode while still in the store. Barcode reading needs to be robust to challenging conditions such as blur, noise, low resolution, or low-quality camera lenses, all of which are extremely common. Surprisingly, even state-of-the-art barcode reading algorithms fail when some of these factors come into play. One reason resides in the early commitment strategy that virtually all existing algorithms adopt: The image is first binarized and then only the binary data are processed. We propose a new approach to barcode decoding that bypasses binarization. Our technique relies on deformable templates and exploits all of the gray-level information of each pixel. Due to our parameterization of these templates, we can efficiently perform maximum likelihood estimation independently on each digit and enforce spatial coherence in a subsequent step. We show by way of experiments on challenging UPC-A barcode images from five different databases that our approach outperforms competing algorithms. Implemented on a Nokia N95 phone, our algorithm can localize and decode a barcode on a VGA image (640 × 480, JPEG compressed) in an average time of 400-500 ms.","0162-8828;01628828","","10.1109/TPAMI.2010.229","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5674056","Barcodes;UPC-A;deformable templates.;mobile devices","Approximation algorithms;Cameras;Cellular phones;Computer vision;Decoding;Image edge detection;Image segmentation;Visualization","cameras;computer vision;decoding;image coding;mark scanning equipment;mobile computing;mobile handsets;photographic lenses","1D barcode reading;Nokia N95 phone;UPC-A barcode image;VGA image;barcode decoding;binary data;bypasses binarization;camera cellphone;camera lens;deformable template;gray-level information;maximum likelihood estimation;mobile phone;mobile vision application;spatial coherence","1","13","3","14","","","20101223","Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Traditional version control systems still provide control over changes to source codes in software engineering, but they are expected to play a major role in service innovation. Incremental changes in service provisions increase value, productivity and consumer satisfaction. From a business perspective, the challenge arises when the revision control helps in to decide whether a new version of a SaaS application should be released and define metrics to determine that users should migrate to a new version after several minor or major revisions. Based on the versionology theory, we introduce a metric-based system to evaluate the distance between successive versions and extrapolate users' resistance to change and their capacity to integrate a new version.

The effects of renewable energy development are increasing at a time when transmission investments are decreasing. In many places, the structure of the power grid is returning to the more isolated city regions that were the norm before high-voltage transmission linked larger geographic areas. Today’s transmission system is stressed by an increasing lack of inertia, poor frequency control, and the need for improved voltage control. The smart grid is an outgrowth of this evolution as a result of communications systems having low cost and increased capabilities. Competitive markets, such as transactive energy, further complicate the operation and planning of the system. Students and industry practitioners alike would be well served by reading this book which covers all aspects of dynamic simulation and control under the assumption that readers are familiar with steady-state behavior, which is not discussed in this text. The book has two goals: 1) to show how to model generation by fully considering the increased use of power electronics for converter control and coordination and 2) to introduce consensus control for interarea oscillations. The author’s goal is to provide a bridge between traditional control and microgrid control. That goal is fully achieved.

Nevertheless, the book will serve as an excellent reference for students and instructors alike looking to learn about the field.

China","IEEE Control Systems","20170118","2017","37","1","125","127","This book provides a comprehensive study of nonlinear adaptive robust model predictive control (MPC). Chapters 2–5 present a framework for the analysis and synthesis of nonlinear robust MPC. This framework includes the treatment of robustness, computation methods, and performance improvement. Chapters 6–7 show how to develop the basic ideas for the design and analysis of the nonlinear adaptive robust MPC. One of the key techniques is the set-based approach, in which the internal model identifier allows the MPC to compensate for future changes in the parameter estimates and uncertainty associated with the unknown model parameters. Chapters 8–12 illustrate how to implement the synthesis approaches for nonlinear adaptive robust MPC, and a robust adaptive economic MPC is also proposed. This text also gives a finite-time identification method, which can be used to estimate the unknown parameters in finite time, provided a persistence of excitation (PE) condition is satisfied. This identification method is particularly effective in the online implementation of MPC. The early chapters study continuous-time systems, and Chapters 13–14 extend the set-based estimation and robust adaptive MPC to discrete-time problems. While adaptive robust MPC is an improvement on robust MPC, this book shows that feedback MPC can be used to improve the open-loop MPC. At each sampling instant, a sequence of parameter estimates can be performed/invoked to improve the control performance. Economic MPC is also incorporated so as to improve the control performance in a broader way. This book is intended for someone learning functions of a complex variable and who enjoys using Matlab. It will enhance the experience of learning complex-variable theory and will strengthen the knowledge of someone already trained in this branch of advanced calculus. Supplying students with a bridge between the functions of complex-variable theory and Matlab, this supplemental text enables inst- uctors to easily add a Matlab component to their complex-variables courses. The book shows students how Matlab can be a powerful learning aid in such staples of complex-variable theory as conformal mapping, infinite series, contour integration, and Laplace and Fourier transforms.

They look for the flaws in the pattern, and that's where the bugs are.""","1750-9637;17509637","","10.1049/et.2015.0933","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7587312","","","","","","","","","","","","October 2015","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

The authors are both top-notch experts on this subject. With almost 400 pages of encyclopedic information, this is a full-size book containing a lot of rigorous and useful information. It is a good reference book and will be kept on a conveniently accessible shelf of every active CEM researcher’s bookcase. The title of the book alludes to CEM, but the information contained in the book may be useful in many other computational disciplines. Graglia and Peterson extensively worked on and published the core matter of this book for at least two decades; there is no question that they are the authoritative voices in this field, the book provides a comprehensive summary of the research performed by them. Because the authors have been drawing their applications from the CEM field, they titled the book accordingly. Nevertheless, the high-order techniques discussed spill over to other disciplines as well. The book contains several tables on interpolatory vector bases and hierarchical bases in an effort to present comprehensive and readily available systematized information to CEM programmers for rapid implementation of the higher-order basis functions described. The intended audience of this book is primarily CEM researchers and programmers and focuses on the high-level concepts pertaining to the inner workings of numerical solutions of integral and differential equations. As such, it is not an introductory text but may be used as a graduate-level textbook in specialized CEM courses concentrating on the higher-order discretizations of integral and/or differential equations. This text is particularly useful to those researchers who work with detailed mathematical formulations, numerical analysis, and actual coding.","1045-9243;10459243","","10.1109/MAP.2016.2541603","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7482886","","Book reviews;Computational electromagnetics;Differential equations;Encoding;Higher order statistics;Integral equations;Numerical analysis","","","","","","","","","","June 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In fact, it is more than that???it is 1000 pages of printed matter supplemented by an extensive collection of electronic materials that include images, Matlab code, interactive examples, instructor assistance and other resources, all held on a dedicated home page at the University of Michigan. Although its principal impact derives from the combination of the printed and electronic matter, the book can stand alone if necessary, particularly for the practitioner. But for the student the electronic material is essential and multiplies the value of the book severalfold. This is because some of the problems set at the end of each chapter use the electronic resources very effectively. These exercises add substantially to the utility of the book as a senior level text, especially since solutions are available on the home page for the instructor. It is hard to overstate the value added by the material on the home page; but it is essential that it be maintained over the life of the book. The publication effectively blends a textbook with a reference manual, and a treatment for the systems designer designer with a course for the remote sensing applications specialist. Its coverage is broad and deep; its completeness means that the reader has little need to consult other books for introductory or supplementary material. Nevertheless adequate referencing is provided to more detailed treatments when relevant. The lead and contributing authors are the authorities in imaging radar and radiometry.","2473-2397;24732397","","10.1109/MGRS.2015.2398391","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7067059","","Book reviews;Radar imaging;Remote sensing","","","","0","","","","","","March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The coding illustrations demonstrate common techniques for the ordering of algorithms. At the same time, it introduces the reader to Python, a language which is growing in popularity among engineers and scientists.

In this book we get a complete description of the approach including the formal underpinning, practical examples, case studies and Matlab code to implement aspects of fuzzy networks.","1556-603X;1556603X","","10.1109/MCI.2011.2176777","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6132216","","Book reviews;Complex networks;Fuzzy logic;MATLAB","","","","0","","","","","","Feb. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
